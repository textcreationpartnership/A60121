            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The Magiſtracy and Government of</hi> England <hi>Vindicated; or a Juſtification of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Method of Proceedings againſt Criminals, by way of Anſwer to the Defence of the late Lord</hi> Ruſſel<hi>'s Innocence,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the preſent Age, when the variety and multiplicity of new Prints is ſuch, that the money and time required for their purchaſe and peruſal, is more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gentleman can reaſonably allow; it may deſervedly be thought a Nuſance to the publick to have their numbers increaſed, eſpecially ſince the Complaint of the ingenious Authour of the Trimmers Character, that for this very cauſe he could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt have wiſhed himſelf unable to read; but yet the Support of Magiſtracy and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is a noble Theme, ſo uſefull to the publick, and ſo generally agreeable to the humour of Mankind, that the mere Subject will (I preſume) be an Excuſe for this Publication, if any thing can be ſo.</p>
            <p>At this time of day none would have thought that a neceſſity ſhould happen of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon ſuch a Topick, when every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant was entertaining himſelf with the pleaſing Proſpect of impartial, due, and indifferent Adminiſtrations, when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was becoming amiable and eaſie to the People, when the People were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a zeal and affection for the honour of Magiſtrates; in ſhort, when the Law was recovering its clouded Credit: in this Conjuncture none expected to ſee all the Pillars and Poſts in the Town daubed with plentifull Title Pages (like ſo many Hiſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omaſtrixes of <hi>Will. Prinn</hi>'s) directing their Spectators to Books of Obloquy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, not only on the Perſons and Opinions, but the Authority of Judges; when neither of the three are corrigible, or ſo much as cenſurable any otherwiſe than in and by a Parliament; much leſs was it expected, that a Gentleman of the long Robe would appear in Print to ridicule their own Profeſſion, and expoſe our Law even to the Scorn of Foreigners. It would not have been ſo very ſtrange to have ſeen a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Commons exerciſing his Wit and Railery on the Common Law Proceedings when he ſaw his deareſt <hi>Diana,</hi> I mean his Excommunication Proceſs, in danger of becoming uſeleſs, and a fair occaſion given him for ſuch an Eſſay from the Diſguſt of the People againſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall.</p>
            <p>But none imagined that Satyrs and Invectives upon paſt Proceedings ſhould be writ by Lawyers, who expect a farther Benefit from their Profeſſion by the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Government, which if they happen to acquire, according to their Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I would only remember them, that Mocking is catching in the Proverb. There was once upon a time a certain Maſter of Arts, who, whilſt at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> did ridicule and expoſe the Clergy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, by writing the pretended Cauſes of their Contempt; but the <hi>Templers</hi> ſaid, that he, whilſt at <hi>London,</hi> did give an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a third Part to the ſame Tune, or at leaſt a new Edition of the Book, with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions by the Authour himſelf, even of his own dull — as proper for the like uſe. In petty Corporations they who have moſt complained of others hardſhips have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently outdone their Predeceſſors, when once they have got their places. A whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning complaining Servant doth often prove a peeviſh imperious Maſter; and I am ſure, in the Inns of Court, the moſt noiſie, troubleſome and mutinous Students and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106204:3"/>Barriſters make the ſtiffeſt and moſt magiſterial Benchers. I make no application, but I leave the Reader to doe what he pleaſeth. Better things are to be hoped of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in publick Government.</p>
            <p>Since the Preſs ſeems open, and Lawyers Books are publiſhed without a Licenſe, another may aſſume the ſame Liberty with equal Authority, and with more Reaſon, when his Province is only to correct the Miſrepreſentations of Things, Actions, and Perſons, though made by Authours of Age, Experience, Figure, and Learning, (I will not ſay Candour or Honeſty,) eſpecially ſince they are private Men, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vented their own Thoughts in Print, they remain no longer theirs, but are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed to the Cenſure or Applauſe of every Reader. Beſides, 'tis generaly preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that an Authour expects a publick Animadverſion, or otherwiſe he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have become ſuch. He preſumes his Arguments irrefragable, and then an Anſwer does him no miſchief; and if they are otherwiſe, he deſerves it. And ſurely he ſtands as liable to be corrected by others, as others were to be cenſured by him. And it is more warrantable certainly to write and print for the Vindication of former Proceedings, than it can be either candid or gentile to arraign or expoſe them; eſpecially ſince to do ſo, is and muſt needs be miſchievous to paſt, preſent, and future Governments, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will unqueſtionably teach us; but the other is and will be of ſervice to future Adminiſtrations, by maintaining the Reputation and Credit of Judiciary Proceedings.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> being ſo unfortunate as to fall under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of Treaſon, was the moſt pitied of any under thoſe Circumſtances, by all who knew either his Family or perſonal Character; great expectations were then had of the Iſſue of that Tryall, the Event gave great occaſion for Diſcourſe afterwards, and almoſt ever ſince; the printing of his laſt Speech, with the ſeveral Anſwers to it, did much augment the Talk. It cannot but be remembred how various and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent the Sentiments of moſt were upon that Subject; the Debates concerning it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded in a pity to his Perſon and Relations, as a great Misfortune upon both, and in truth upon the Nation, that a Gentleman of ſuch Qualifications ſhould be guilty of ſo much Inadvertency (to ſay no worſe) as to engage ſo frequently in ſuch Conſults as he unhappily did. Some blamed the Jury, moſt cenſured the Witneſſes, but very few arraigned either Counſel or Court; and in truth the fairneſs and indifferency of that Trial was ſuch, that his own Relations were pleaſed, and his Enemies angry with thoſe that then ſate upon the Bench; and thus it continued till the preſent Revolution.</p>
            <p>Then the Memory of that unfortunate Gentleman was revived by the publication of a Defence of his Innocency; the Name ſubſcribed to the Title-page is ſo great, that I ſhould be affraid to proceed, but that I am reſolved not to be known; and therefore if any thing falls from my Pen indecent or diſreſpectfull, he muſt excuſe it as a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege claimed by Authours, eſpecially of Books that have no Name to them.</p>
            <p>To begin at the end; for what purpoſe was that Pamphlet printed?</p>
            <p>It could not be for the good of the Nation, as a means for conſumption of Paper; for, as I have been told, that's a <hi>French</hi> Commodity.</p>
            <p>It could not be for the Bookſeller's profit only, for a reaſon to be gueſſed at.</p>
            <p>It could not be for the ſake of that Lord's Memory, or any of his ſurviving Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; for no Man will think it a ſervice to them, to renew the thoughts of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy accident in ſo noble, ancient, and worthy a Family. In truth, the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106204:3"/>is nothing but a painting to the life the too deep concern of that Branch on't in a weak as well as criminal Enterpriſe; for what elſe doth ſignifie the Expreſſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. that being preſent at a Conſult of Traitors a ſecond time, or oftner, raiſes a ſtrong ſuſpicion, that the party who does ſo, likes it, conſents to it, and approves it; or elſe he would have forborn after his having been once amongſt them. And many other ſuch Expreſſions there are with the like Reflections, as <hi>pag.</hi> 7. that <hi>Rumſey</hi> and <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,</hi> the two firſt Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> raiſe a ſtrong ſuſpicion upon my Lord, and make it probable that he was guilty. And in the ſame Page the Author ſeems to agree him guilty of Miſpriſion. And <hi>pag.</hi> 17. he re-publiſhes the Evidence of <hi>Rumſey,</hi> that there was a conſent, and this the Author agrees to be High Treaſon; but he then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to invalidate the Credibility of that Evidence, by ſhewing the wildneſs of his own memory. Now how this could ſerve the Reputation of the Deceaſed, or cure the Reſentment of his Relations upon that account, I confeſs my ſelf utterly unable to imagine. Nor can any Reader ſuppoſe the Title verified by the Book, <hi>viz. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Innocence,</hi> when there's not one word to be read of it but in the Frontiſpiece. Surely there's no thanks due to the Author from that Family, no more than was an extraordinary Fee due to that Lawyer who pleaded for a Defendant to this effect: <hi>My Client, I muſt confeſs, is a Wag, but not ſo great a Wag as the Counſel of the other ſide would repreſent him; their proof is very ſtrong, but not ſo ſtrong as they would boaſt it to be; our Defence is but dark and weak, but not ſo weak as they would argue it.</hi> So that the Book could not be writ for a Service to that Family, unleſs a conceſſion of Guilt can be called <hi>a Vindication of Innocence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It could not be for the ſake of the Government; for it can never be deemed a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Service to rake into old Sores, when lenifying and moderate methods are more adviſeable; and if every thing ſhould be re-publiſhed which hath given diſguſt to the People, few would eſcape the laſh, the righteous themſelves would ſcarcely be ſaved, for abundance of them have tript either in their publick or private converſation, and ſome in both, and that notoriouſly too: I name no Body. Beſides, the Government muſt of neceſſity never allow the Doctrines divulged in this Pamphlet, unleſs 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that its being and continuance ſhall be as precarious as a <hi>Beneplacito</hi> Judgſhip, and as dependent upon the Peoples humour as that is upon the King's: nor can any Government countenance and encourage the Arraignment of a conſiderable number of wealthy worthy Citizens, with the Printed Cenſure and Inſinuation of their being a parcel of corrupt, ignorant, injudicious, diſhoneſt and partial Fellows, and this is done to the full, when ſaid, that the contrary would have ſworn to a not guilty, or at leaſt wiſe they ſhould, if the Author had been there. But moſt of his Readers are of another opinion, notwithſtanding the ſecond Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>It could not be for the ſake of popular Applauſe; for it's thought, that the Treatiſe will never deſerve or procure it, eſpecially if you take it in pieces, and conſider them apart, and with ſober Reflections. So that no Man can tell what it was writ for.</p>
            <p>When the Title of the Book, and Name of the Author was firſt publiſhed, Mankind was full with a pregnant expectation of ſome rare, abſtruſe, uncommon Learning upon the Point of Treaſons with which the World was before unacquainted. No Man looked for a Preachment concerning the Body and Blood of our Saviour, the World to come, and the Guards of Heaven, as Topicks proper for an Animadverſion upon that Trial, eſpecially from ſuch an Author. But there's nothing ſtrange under the Sun</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106204:4"/>
            <p>The Preface is an Encomium upon the Author himſelf, declaratory of his readineſs for publick Services, and ſeems to be calculated for a Cooler, or a Defence againſt the Heats and Rigors of an harſh and oppreſſive Government, for an help to ſuch as may poſſibly hereafter fall into the like danger and trouble: and to teach the People the fear and jealouſie of a poſſibility of ſuch Occurrences again, can never be thought a publick Service. As to part of the Preface, it is ſo dark, that a ſlender underſtanding can never reach the ſenſe of it, I mean that long Paragraph, <hi>The Copies of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt Letter begins with a ſeeming ſhew of a bold reſolution in the Author to perform the Duty of a Friendly Council, maugre all the inconveniencies that might happen to himſelf thereby. But it concludes with an extraordinary caution and care to prevent all danger, even to ſuch a degree as much diminiſhes the credit of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible and heroick Reſolution at firſt boaſted of. And if his Courage had been ſo ſtrong, why were not theſe Letters publiſhed formerly, and in times when in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's judgment there was more occaſion for their uſe, than the preſent can poſſibly afford? But rather it may be again asked why are they Printed at all, the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contained in them having been Printed not above 500 times already, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with as much advantage? Was it a Secret to the World, that a variance between the Indictment and the Evidence might be alledged on the general Iſſue? Did no Man in Town know that Treaſon and the Miſpriſion of it are different Crimes? Is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them ſuch a new invention, and ſo very uſefull, as to be an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for the want of Council in capital Trials, as the Preface and Letter do inſinuate, if they do any thing? Who ever doubted, but that proofs of Treaſon muſt not be by hear ſay or argument only? Was it ever a queſtion for this hundred years, but that every Indictment of Treaſon muſt contain an Overt-act? Or that leſs than two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes was allowable for proof of that Crime? Or did any Man ever ſcruple but that <hi>Keble</hi>'s Statute-Book contains a true Copy of the 13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. which requires Witneſſes credible? Now if theſe Queſtions muſt be anſwered in the Negative, how can the advice of theſe Letters be aſſiſtant to a better Defence, than was known long ſince?</p>
            <p>The Book it ſelf begins with Stories of Tranſubſtantiation of Bodies, and Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls, as much to the purpoſe, as the Parſon's Text was to his Doctrine, who preached upon the certainty of a day of Judgment from that Verſe in <hi>Geneſis, And Adam knew Eve, and ſhe conceived,</hi> &amp;c. But perhaps the Author intended all that firſt Page for a Flouriſh, and to entice his Reader into a patient peruſal of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and prejudice him againſt the Sheet he pretends to anſwer. He is very frank in ſtyling it a Libellous Pamphlet, and the Author ſome rank bigotted Papiſt; but to what purpoſe no Man can divine, unleſs it were to expoſe him to the rage of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile; but his Name was never poſted, and ſo he is ſafe from that danger.</p>
            <p>The Aſſertions are two, that there was neither Charge nor Proof, that the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Evidence were both inſufficient.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that it would be a mighty Addition to the Liberty of the Subject, to have the Law eſtabliſhed, and declared to be what the late Judge doth argue it is; for then there would be a freedom for Malecontents to endeavour their own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action by Conſpiracies and Conſults, and that with impunity. But as the Law was, and always hath been taken to be, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject hath very little colour for his pretence to ſuch a privilege as that Doctrine gives.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106204:4"/>
            <p>The Indictment is, that at ſuch a place and time <hi>he did compaſs and imagine not only to deprive the King of his Government and Royal State, but to kill and put him to death, and to procure a miſerable Slaughter amongſt the King's Subjects; and to ſubvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> England, <hi>and to raiſe a Rebellion againſt the King.</hi> Then follows, <hi>That to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill and perfect theſe Treaſons and traiterous Imaginations, he, together with other Traiters, did then and there with them traiterouſly conſult, conſpire, conclude and agree to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and to ſeiſe and deſtroy the Guards of the King's Perſon,</hi> contra, &amp;c. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe laſt acts be not a natural and genuine Evidence of the former, let any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man judge. But I will particularly prove, that this Indictment was ſufficient to warrant the Judgment which the Court gave, and pronounced upon a Verdict, that the accuſed was guilty of that Fact in the Indictment, and then anſwer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ſtarted againſt it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there's a ſufficient Treaſon alledged. And ſecondly, here's a ſufficient Overt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act; both theſe I'll agree are neceſſary, and if either were wanting, the Indictment was naught. Now it muſt be agreed to me, that the firſt is clear and plain, for by the Law to compaſs or imagine the death of the King, Queen, or their eldeſt Son, is High Treaſon. It is true by the ſame Law ſome open act of which humane Juſtice can take a conuſance is requiſite to be proved; the very words of the Statute do expreſly require it; and in truth it is no more than what muſt have been, had no ſuch words been uſed; for thoughts are ſecret, and can never be arraigned, proved, or cenſured, any otherwiſe than as they are diſcovered by ſome Overt act; ſo that that Clauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring an appearance of the compaſſing and imagination by ſome Overt-act or open Deed, is no more than would have been impliedly requiſite, had the Clauſe been omitted. 'Tis the imagination and compaſſing which is the Treaſon, that alone is the <hi>Crimen leſae Majeſtatis,</hi> which is prohibited and condemned; the Overt-act is not the Treaſon, that's only a neceſſary Circumſtance, without which no Court can ever take conuſance of the other. And it is neceſſary to alledge ſome ſuch Deed, <hi>à ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate rei,</hi> without reſpect to the words of that Statute. I inſiſt the longer upon this, becauſe it is uſed as an Objection, that the Clauſe of <hi>proveably attaint by,</hi> &amp;c. is reſtrictive, whereas it is not ſo: for it is only to make that firſt ſpecified Treaſon of Imagination and Compaſſing to be a thing intelligible and triable; and farther to prove this, it is conſiderable, that this Requiſite of the Overt-act is of uſe and neceſſity barely, and only in the caſe of that which is firſt mentioned, <hi>viz. Compaſſing;</hi> for the other ſorts of Treaſon are Acts themſelves whereof notice may be had, as levying War, violating the Queen's Bed, and the like; and in an Indictment you need only alledge the Facts themſelves, as that there was a War levied, there was a carnal knowledge had, and the like. And this farther appears from the very Form of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments uſed ever ſince that Statute; for there never was an Indictment (and if there were, it could never be good) barely averring an Overt-act without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs allegation of the Compaſſing.</p>
            <p>Then the matter reſults ſolely into this Queſtion, Whether the Fact here laid be naturally and neceſſarily declaratory of the Parties Imagination to deſtroy the King; for if ſo, the Indictment is undoubtedly good; and it can never be called a conſtructive Treaſon, or a thing deviſed by the Judge's Iterpretation of the Statute; for they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge no more Treaſon, than what the Statute declares, and that is an Imagination of the King's Death; now whatſoever is ſignificative of a Man's intention or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106204:5"/>is a ſufficient Overt-deed to demonſtrate that that Man had ſuch intention or imagination; and whatſoever is expreſſive or ſignificative of a Mans intending, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing, or imagining of the King's Death, is a ſufficient Overt act to prove and make ſuch a Man a Traitor within this Law. Now that a Conſult about, and an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concluſion actually to ſeiſe the King's Guards, and raiſe a Rebellion, are a natural and genuine Declaration, that the Perſon who did ſo conſult, agree and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, did compaſs and imagine the Death of the King, is ſurely plain enough; for a Rebellion, if ſuccesfull, can determine in nothing elſe but the King's Death, either Natural or Civil, which is all one within this Law; now he that deſigns and intends the neceſſary means naturally conducing to a particular end, that Man may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to intend and deſign that end, <hi>Cauſa Cauſae eſt Cauſa Cauſati.</hi> If the Deed tend and conduce to the Executionof the Treaſon, that's a ſufficient overt Act ſays <hi>Coke</hi> 3. <hi>Inſt.</hi> 12. and in the ſame Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 6. he hath theſe Words, <hi>That he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth by overt Act to depoſe the King, is a ſufficient overt Act to prove that he compaſſeth and imagineth the Death of the King;</hi> and ſo it is to impriſon the King, to get him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Power; and to manifeſt the ſame by ſome overt Act, this is alſo a ſufficient overt Act for the intent aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> p. 12. 'tis held that a <hi>Preparation</hi> by ſome overt Act to depoſe the King, or take the King by force and ſtrong hand, or to impriſon him till he hath yielded to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Demands, that is a ſufficient overt Act to prove the compaſſing and imagination of the King's Death; for that this, upon the matter, is to make the King a Subject, and to deſpoil him of his Regal Office; and ſo he ſays it was reſolved by all the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>England, Hill.</hi> 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. in the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray, Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> Seminary Prieſts; and ſo he tells us in the ſame place, that it had been reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Juſtices in the Caſe of the Earls <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> Now if we conſider the reaſon why theſe were overt Acts of Treaſon, 'twill appear to be onely becauſe of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency to the accompliſhment of that particular Treaſon of compaſſing, which holds the ſame in the Authour's Caſe as well as in thoſe there mentioned.</p>
            <p>A Conſpiracy with a Foreign Prince is agreed by my Lord <hi>Coke, ib.</hi> 14. to be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it be to invade the Realm; and an overt Act of ſuch practice to be a ſufficient overt Act of a compaſſing the King's Death; and the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch Actions cannot be thought to be intended for any other purpoſe: and yet that particular Act may be accompliſhed, and it may ſo happen, as that the King's Death may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and yet they are overt Acts of that treaſonable Imagination becauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciveneſs and tendency thereto. The Caſe of Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> was, writing a Book of the Pope's Supremacy, in which were contained Incitements of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor to an Invaſion of this Realm; and that was held an overt Act of imagining the King's Death. In the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s Caſe, a Conſpiracy, Conſult and Agreement to promote an Inſurrection and procure an Invaſion, was held an overt Act, 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. and their meeting, conſulting and agreeing, was laid as an overt Act, though diſcovered before the thing took effect. Dr. <hi>Story</hi>'s Caſe, which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Lords <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Coke,</hi> was no more than a Practice or Perſuaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote an Inſurrection and Invaſion, and the overt Act that was alledged was the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Letters for that purpoſe; which is no more influential towards it, nor ſo much, as frequently meeting, conſulting and conſpiring, and at laſt concluding and agreeing to make an Inſurrection. The Caſe of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was no other; for whatſoever the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106204:5"/>Indictment laid, the Evidence was onely of Letters to the like effect (as to this point) with thoſe of Dr. <hi>Story;</hi> and the Caſe of Dr. <hi>Story</hi> was before the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which made a new Treaſon during her Life; for the Tryal was in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did not begin till <hi>April</hi> following. A Machination or Agreement to raiſe a Rebellion naturally tends to the Deſtruction both of King and People; and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to it hath been adjudged ſo: as in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4 one <hi>Balſhal</hi> going from <hi>London,</hi> found one <hi>Bernard</hi> at Plow in the Pariſh of <hi>Ofley</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford; Balſhal</hi> told him that King <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. was alive in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which was falſe, for he was then dead) and adviſed him to get Men, and go to King <hi>Richard:</hi> in <hi>Mich.</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Rot.</hi> 4. you'll find this adjudged Treaſon. <hi>Throgmorton</hi>'s Caſe is as plain, for his was onely a Conſpiracy to levy War within this Realm; he did not join in the Execution, and the Conſpiracy alone was declared to be a ſufficient overt Act by the Judges; 'Tis no Anſwer to it, to ſay, that a War was afterwards levied, for <hi>quoad</hi> him 'twas a bare Conſult; his Offence was no more than that In Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Caſe, meeting and conſulting were alledged and held to be overt Acts. The Caſe of <hi>Conſtable,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, was onely an Act tending to depoſing the Queen, as diſperſing Bills in the Night, that <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. was alive and in <hi>France:</hi> and held an overt Act declarative of his compaſſing her Death, and he was executed for it: and in the Report of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s Caſe you have ſeveral other Caſes mentioned, where endeavours to draw Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Allegiance have been adjudged overt Acts of this ſpecies of Treaſon, The compaſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word Compaſs in the Statute is of a larger extent than onely to mean an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſſault on the King's Perſon, and an endeavour to cut his Throat; it moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly implies any Conſult or Practice of another thing directly which may produce that effect, as the diſſuading People from their Fidelity; ſuch was <hi>Owen</hi>'s Caſe in King <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. his time, in the 13th. year of that Reign: this Advice was to this effect, That King <hi>James</hi> being excommunicated by the Pope, might be killed by any man, and that ſo to doe was no murther; for being convicted by the Pope's Sentence, he might be ſlaughtered without a fault, as an Executioner hangs a Criminal condemned by Law: and for this he was hanged as a Traitor. He that denies the Title to the Crown, and endeavours to ſet it upon another's Head, may doe this without a direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate deſiring the Death of him that wears it; (ſo ſaid <hi>Saint-John</hi> in his Argument againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi>) and yet this is Treaſon, as was adjudged in the Caſe of <hi>Burton,</hi> and in the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Caſe, 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> This denying of the Title, with Motives, though but impliedly of Action againſt it, hath been adjudged an overt Act of Compaſſing the King's Death, as it was in <hi>John Sparhawke</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Paſch.</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Rot.</hi> 12. The like was the Caſe of <hi>John Awater,</hi> who was indicted for a Treaſon of that nature in <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Indictment removed into B. R. <hi>Trin.</hi> 18. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. ſee <hi>Rot.</hi> 17. and he was thereupon afterwards out lawed as a Traitor; and ſo was <hi>Thomas Heber</hi> at the ſame time; and words ſignificative of an actual Intention have been held ſo, as are the Opinions of <hi>Yelver.</hi> 107.197. <hi>Aarthur Crohagan</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 332. and abundance of others might be named as they are reported in our Law-Books, but I do not particularly mention them, for that their Authority in ſome of them is very ſlender, and may be ill uſed, to the ſtraining of raſh and unadviſed Words into a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of a man's compaſſing, when perhaps the man never thought as he ſpoke: however all of them do evince, that adviſed and deliberate Preparations moving to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106204:6"/>a danger to the King's Perſon, have all along been held overt Acts of a compaſſing his Death; and ſome of them prove, that Preparatives and Motives to the levying of a War have been held Treaſon, as was Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 119. for making Ballads reflecting upon the King, and writing Letters to the men of <hi>Kent,</hi> exciting them to riſe to aid the then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ad guerram levandam;</hi> and no mention of any War actually levyed. <hi>Germain</hi> and <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>'s Indictment hath very little more in it mentioned than the like Preparations and Incitements to a Rebellion; and yet the Treaſon there laid was a Compaſſing of the King's Death, <hi>anno</hi> 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. The Caſe of <hi>Thomas Burdett,</hi> in 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. as at large it appears in the ſame Report of <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> amounts to no more than the Indictment in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That he compaſſed the King's Death; and to accompliſh that Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he did diſperſe divers Writings, &amp;c. <hi>ad intentionem</hi> that the People ſhould riſe and levy War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Judgment in that Caſe, Drawing, Hanging and Quartering: the like in <hi>Collingbourn</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. in the ſame Rep. 122. where he is indicted in like manner, for exciting and moving the People to an Inſurrection and War, and he incurred the like Judgment; which Caſes are infinitely ſhort of this in queſtion: and it cannot but be wondred that any man who has read them ſhould queſtion whether a conſulting and conſpiring about riſing, and an actual agreement and determination to riſe, be an overt Act of compaſſing the King's Death. In the very Tryal of the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> it is affirmed by Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> (who was certainly of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Authour) that the meeting and conſulting together is an overt Act, though the thing agreed on be never put in Execution; and 'tis there reſolved by the Judges that the ſame Treaſon may be proved by two Witneſſes to ſeveral overt Acts, though one ſpeak of Words or Actions that were ſpoken or done at one time and place, and another ſpeak of Words or Actions at another time and place; which argues that Words, much more a Conſult and Agreement, may make an overt Act. Even in the Caſe of <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> in which though the Tryal hath been cenſured, yet the Indictment never was, and in that Indictment the Treaſon is laid as in this Caſe, That he traiterouſly imagined and compaſſed the King to depoſe, kill and deſtroy; the overt Acts are, That he armed himſelf, and adviſed others to arm, and ſpoke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here was no War levied, onely a Preparation, and yet that was allowed an overt Act: and as for the Words, if they are allowed to be one, with much more reaſon may Meeting, Conſulting, Concluding, and Agreeing to doe.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, Surely there is no weight in the firſt, which is <hi>Page</hi> 10. that criticiſes upon the word <hi>fait</hi> Act, and that 'tis onely a meeting to agree, and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe, but 'twas not done: Suppoſe they had concluded and agreed to poiſon or ſtab, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Opinion in that Page, this was no Treaſon; for 'tis onely agreeing and concluding upon a thing to be done, but it is not done. He doth in Page 13. argue that this can never be an overt Act of compaſſing the King's Death, becauſe levying War is a diſtinct ſpecies of Treaſon, and a conſpiring to levy War is not a levying War, and even levying War it ſelf cannot be aſſign'd as an overt Act of compaſſing, unleſs the Indictment were particularly for that: but ſurely another ſort of Act that favours of another ſpecies of Treaſon, if it naturally conduce to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of the firſt ſpecies, <hi>viz.</hi> that of compaſſing, it may be aſſigned as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Act of it; and Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Caſe is quite otherwiſe, and there a levying War was the overt Act alledged of the compaſſing, and allowed by all the Judges;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106204:6"/>and all the Indictments in the <hi>Weſt</hi> upon <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion were ſo, and yet drawn by very good Advice; beſides, what Anſwer can be given to the Caſes which I have cited, where Conſults, Conſpiracies, Practices, Advices, Letters, Perſuaſions, and other Motives and Preparatives to an Inſurrection, have been held overt Acts of an Imagination of the King's Death, though no War was levied, though no Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was made.</p>
            <p>'Tis apparent from what was ſaid before, that to take the King Priſoner, or to ſeize his Perſon, is a compaſſing of his Death; and if ſo, then to ſit in Council to conſpire the effecting of that, is an overt Act of a compaſſing the King's Death: and this Caſe amounts to, that here was a Conſultation to ſeize upon the King's Guards, which could tend to nothing but the ſeizing of his Perſon; and then the conſequence is plain. The Authour ſays, Page 14. If it had but been alledged in the Indictment, that in purſuance of the Conſult and Agreement, there had been a view of the Guards, and a Report made that the thing was feaſible, this would have been more to the purpoſe, how much more, no man can tell; for every Objection in the Book would have been as good againſt that as this. The great Objection he ſeems to rely on, is, That the Law takes no notice of them: for once I will ſuppoſe that it doth not, and then let us obſerve if any Argument can be drawn from thence: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the thing was not uſed or known when the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was made. Can nothing be Treaſon if the Plot laid to accompliſh it be concerning a thing not in <hi>eſſe</hi> at the time of the Statute? Certainly it may. If ſeveral Malecontents ſhould conſult and agree and prepare (in order to an Inſurrection) to ſeize the <hi>Tower, Portſmouth, Hull,</hi> and <hi>Plymouth</hi> Fort, would not this be an overt Act of Treaſon? and yet our Law takes no notice of any Garriſons there or any where elſe; they have no relation to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, nor were there any Arms in thoſe places in <hi>Edward</hi> 3. his time that we reade of in our Law Books: if this be otherwiſe. Why did not the Authour find fault wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s Indictment, which was tried much at the ſame time with this in queſtion. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Gentlemen-Penſioners, Grooms of the Stole, Gentlemen of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the like, killed in the Night, and the doors in <hi>White-hall</hi> broken up, and all the Swords, Muſquets and Piſtols there taken away, and yet it happened that the King's Perſon was left untouched; would this be an Act of Burglary and Murther onely? We have no Law-Books that take notice of Arms at <hi>White-hall,</hi> or ſuch Names as thoſe Servants go by: and ſuppoſe, at the ſame time, upon the Conſult, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators did move, diſcourſe, debate and conclude of an Inſurrection, would it not then be Treaſon? If not, nothing can be ſo, unleſs the King's Perſon be murthered or ſeized, and the Statute ſhould not have ſaid compaſs or imagine, but ſeize or kill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſuffices then, that the Guards are in common Underſtanding known to be uſed and imployed for the Attendence upon and Preſervation of his Perſon. If common ſenſe and reaſon be Judge, no man can think but that he who intended to move an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and ſeize the Guards, had a farther deſign upon the King's Perſon; and then 'tis Treaſon: if otherwiſe, a King of <hi>England</hi> is in a worſe condition than the worſt and meaneſt of his Subjects; for a King muſt not, cannot in or by our Law, aſſault, ſtrike, ſeize, attach, or impriſon in perſon, and conſequently cannot defend himſelf; and ſhall not his Servants, Guards and Attendents (which are all of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) wear a Sword or carry a Muſquet before him? If they doe ſo, is it not then known that they doe it? If it be commonly known to be ſo, doth not he that ſeizes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106204:7"/>and deſtroys thoſe Attendants, endanger the King's Perſon? And if that be ſo, the Inference is eaſie. It can never be, it will never be allowed for Law, that a ſeizing all the King's Guards is only a breach of the Peace, unleſs we renounce the Law, and will judge more by Inclinations and Partiſhips than by Reaſon and Precedents. As to the diſtinction between an actual ſeizing them, and a Conſult and Agreement to ſeize them, what I have urged before overthrows it; and what the Author ſays doth not maintain it, for both have a tendency to the execution of the Treaſon intended.</p>
            <p>I will not take the pains to remark upon all the Inconſiſtencies of the Conceſſions and Denials in the Book, they are obvious to the Readers. As to his Quarrel at the King's Guards as an illegal thing, and terrible to the People, ſomewhat of the <hi>French</hi> growth, I hope the King will always preſerve them for his own perſonal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, notwithſtanding the Author's Opinion. As to his temporary Laws, which declare Words Treaſon, moſt part of them were affirmative of the old Law, and were made only in complement to a new crowned Head, when they prohibited nothing but what was before ſo: and for the reſt, no Concluſion could be made from them for the maintenance of his Aſſertion if he had repeated them; which ſince he does not, nor will I.</p>
            <p>As to the Caſes cited by the Author of the Antidote (which I have mentioned,) he agrees to <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s Caſe, but does not diſtinguiſh it in its reaſon, from that in diſpute. He denies the Authority and Law of Dr. <hi>Story</hi>'s Caſe, which no body ever denied before him. He ſays that in the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Caſe there were People aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, but gives not any Anſwer to what the Antidote affirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Overt-act taken notice of in the little Book called <hi>The Pleas of the Crown,</hi> was only the conſpiring to make an Inſurrection. He doth confeſs, that in the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>'s Caſe there was only a Conſpiracy: He ſays, that in Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s and <hi>Plunket</hi>'s Caſe there were ſeveral other Ingredients to mount them to Treaſon, but what they were no body muſt learn, at leaſt not from the Author, for he names none of them.</p>
            <p>He conſumes half a Page in an Encomium upon the Judiciouſneſs of that Court which made a conſcientious legal Scruple, Whether the Murther of a Miſtriſs by her Servant were Petit-Treaſon, by reaſon of the difference of her Gender? But at laſt he tells us, That the Judges of the Common Pleas did upon much deliberation ſatisfie thoſe of the King's Bench, that Maſter and Miſtriſs were in effect but one.</p>
            <p>In the concluſion of the firſt Letter he ſays, That Conſpiring againſt the King's Perſon is moſt juſtly taken to be to conſpire againſt the King's Life; but in the Book he will not allow a conſpiring and agreeing to ſeize (<hi>i. e.</hi> beat and deſtroy) the Guards, which are ordinarily and commonly known to attend the King's Perſon, to be a conſpiring againſt his Perſon; which whether it be or not, the next Trial of this Nature will determine. Now after all, what can be a greater Reflection upon the Learning, Judgment, and Integrity of the King's Council, Judges, and Recorder, than to declare and publiſh in Print, that the firſt proſecuted, the ſecond tried, and the laſt condemned a Gentleman as a Traitor, when the Charge had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in't of that nature: If true, the bare Printing it is unbecoming the— But as for their Reputations, let them juſtifie themſelves. The reaſon of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to explode ſuch a Reflection, was my own and every Man's Duty to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, (the King and Queen's Majeſties being both concerned, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently too, in the conſequence of ſuch Doctrines) and a love to my Country-men,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106204:7"/>that they may not preſume upon the Authority of ſuch a defence; for if they do, they may find their Miſtake, when noozed through the power of Truth, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion.</p>
            <p>As to the Proof I will not rake into it, ſince the Author hath repreſented too much of its ſtrength, and <hi>de mortuis nil niſi bonum,</hi> it can never be thought a gratefull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to debate or convince of Guilt; but yet I may ſay ſo much, that there was Evidence enough to juſtifie All concerned in the Proſecution and Trial, though for ſeveral Reaſons the Attainder is fit to be reverſed, but hardly for thoſe which this Author mentions.</p>
            <p>Since the writing of this Sheet, there came to my hands a Treatiſe calling it ſelf <hi>The Lord</hi> Ruſſel<hi>'s Caſe,</hi> which ſavours more of Policy than Law, and his Topicks are the Rights of the People and Power of Parliaments; they argue the Author to be a greater Stateſman than Lawyer, and therefore much too great for me to encounter; and a Debate concerning the Heads he inſiſts on is neither ſafe nor allowable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors. I ſhall make but three Remarks on what he ſays: Firſt, He may aſſure himſelf, That that Power from which he argues his Law, is now apparently lodged in the Commonalty, not in the Nobility. Secondly, The King's Sollicitor (whom he reflects on) twittered more Reaſon and Law than yet hath been or ever will be anſwered: And thirdly, The Indictment contained no new conſtructive Treaſon, but only that which was plainly and directly declared in and by the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. if the Letters of it make Words, and the Words Senſe, and one Man may be allowed able to read them as well as another.</p>
            <p>Since the writing of the laſt Paragraph, there came to my hands another Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let written by a new Obſervator; but I ſuppoſe the Judges that ſhall be will correct that ſort of Licentiouſneſs which he aſſumes in his Remarks: which if they do not, they'll have fine eaſie places on't as well as their Predeceſſors; and much good may it doe them.</p>

               <hi>A Second Vindication of the Magiſtracy and Government of</hi> England, <hi>by way of Anſwer to the ſeveral Replies,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is very obſervable, that ſince the late Revolution, nothing hath more diſturbed our Peace than the Liberty of the Preſs: and amongſt all our new Prints, the moſt malignant and miſchievous Libels on the preſent Government, have been written by thoſe Lawyers who pretend themſelves the greateſt Zealots for its Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which may beſuſpected as falſe, unleſs it be withall conſidered, that ſome modern Royalliſts have nothing recommendatory of themſelves, but the Miſcarriages of others and others of them have ſuch great ones of their own, that an Extenuation or Excuſe is impoſſible, and therefore to cloud their own Deformities they would blacken other Mens Reputations, and in order to it they have cenſured Innocence, and arraigned Laws; and where a ſlip or fault hath been, though ſo ſmall as ſcarcely to deſerve the name of one, they have magnified it into an execrable Villany; and for a colour of ſuch their Calumny and Slander, they have vented new Goſpel and Law both: nay,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106204:8"/>they have broached ſuch Notions to the World, as are directly fatal to that Crown of which they boaſt themſelves the Makers and Supporters, and yet in doing ſo they pretend to merit —</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange but true, for the Fact is plain, and the Conſequence too: upon the preſent Change, the Republicans of both Gowns did deem it their Policy and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to beſpatter and reproach other Mens Actions; and, like baſe and mean Spirits, gave ill names and words to every thing in which themſelves had not been concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made Reviling ſo cuſtomary, that it is become the modiſh Sin of the Age. It is moſt certain the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Honour, Frankneſs, Ingenuity, and good Nature, is quite abandoned from ſome Companies and places in the Town, and inſtead of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have aſſumed a Vice in our common Converſation, inſtead of Drollery and Banter, the new faſhioned Wit at —<hi>'s</hi> allows nothing as acceptable but Lying and Slander; nay the very Spark of a Courtier hath changed his Note: Whereas fulſome, groſs, and falſe Flattery was wont to be his Talent, he is now got to the other Extreme, <hi>i. e.</hi> revengefull, weak, and falſe Characters, both of Perſons and Actions: Which is the worſt is difficult to determine, but Falſhood is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant humour in both; and that Age is ſurely unhappy which is plagued with a Surfeit of either, eſpecially when the Exceſs is ſo great as now, that no Gentleman can be thought a good Companion, no Clergyman a true Proteſtant, no Lawyer an honeſt <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> no Courtier a faithfull Servant, unleſs he can, and do rail and ſnarl, and ſcold, and that at things that were juſtly uſed in former times, and muſt neceſſarily be uſed in theſe times, and will be ſo in all times whatſoever, even in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula Secorum:</hi> theſe little ſtinging Animals do value themſelves upon their Honeſty, becauſe they find Faults, but it is in caſes where no Eye can ſpie them but their own; they value themſelves upon their Wit, becauſe their cenſures are ſharp and biting, but that is ſo eaſie, ſo very eaſie a Province, that Nature teaches even the rudeſt of her Breed to be ſatyrical, and the Natural oftentimes out-does the pretended Scholar in Ribaldry, and hath perhaps a better faculty that way than Fancy and Picquancy of reflection.</p>
            <p>Now as the Fact is thus criminal and ridiculous both, ſo muſt the Conſequence prove fatal to the Government which they would be thought (but intend not) to ſupport; for when once reſolved to arraign all paſt proceedings, they are forced for the maintenance of ſuch their reflections to vent thoſe Opinions, Doctrines and Rules in Divinity and Law, which have in every Age (ſave one) been juſtly exploded as deſtructive to the honour and being of the then Poſſeſſors of the Crown; and can conduce to no other end than the utter Subverſion of this, and every other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that doth but ſmell of a Monarchy.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but in moſt Reigns there have been ſome occaſions given for Diſguſt to the People, that Kings have born too hard upon their Subjects, that the Subjects have worthily complained of ſome Warps from the Law, but no Man ever with Senſe pretended that this is a Reaſon to induce a Belief, that every Act of State, and every Judgment of Law in former times was Arbitrary and Unwarrantable: No ſurely, the Publiſhers of ſuch Reflections are of another thought themſelves; and ſome folks imagine, they who formerly were ingaged in Seditious Practices againſt the Crown, would now upon the preſent occaſion explode that Law which doth condemn ſuch Practices, that they may with impunity repeat them whenſoever the King or his Miniſters ſhal chance to diſoblige them, and that this is the true reaſon of half the new Libels and Invectives upon paſt Proceedings.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106204:8"/>
            <p>It is now apparent to all Mankind, that every Line, or at leaſt Page, of ſome Mens Works are deſigned only as a Courtſhip to the Mobb, by bridling the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and clipping the Prerogative, even to ſuch a degree, as doth abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it of thoſe Rights, Powers, and Authorities, which the ancient Law, continued uſage, and our preſent Repreſentatives conſent to allow it.</p>
            <p>To check this growing itch of Pamphleting the Nation into another Change, and to vindicate the Rights of the Crown, and juſtifie the Magiſtracy of <hi>England</hi> from the obloquy which was induſtriouſly thrown on it in one Particular: there was three Months ſince, a Sheet Printed and Publiſhed, at which ſome Men took offence, but others were of Opinion, that its Publication was ſeaſonable and well timed; that its reflection on the trifling defence which it aſſumed to anſwer, were juſt and ſmooth, and very ſoft, conſidering the occaſion given for a more Satyrical Style from the fondneſs and incoherence of the Defenders expreſſions and inferences, and that the mode of managing his Argument, was modeſt and tender, with a decent and due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the memory of the unfortunate deceaſed, which had ſuffered more than enough of Injury by that pretended Juſtification.</p>
            <p>A Cholerick and Sedulous Enquiry hath been made after the Author's Name, but the inquiſitor is ſtill at a loſs, notwithſtanding his confidence of a certain knowledge who it was that came behind and ſtruck him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to give him ſome ſatisfaction, after all his fatigue in ſearching, I will aſcertain who it was not; he may aſſure himſelf that none concerned in that Trial, were concerned or privy to its Vindication, and when it was Compoſed and Writ, the Party intended it chiefly for his own and the World's diverſion, from the ungratefull neceſſity of Reading always on one ſide, by the interpoſal of a few Lines on the other; that our Humours might not be quite ſowred, and our Genius turn too peeviſh through the influence of Satyr and Libel, with which the World hath too much abounded of late years; nor had there been one word more publiſhed upon that Subject, but that the Authority of the Defender doth challenge a Vindication, and the word of a Prieſt ſays that it needs one; both ſhall have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer preſently.</p>
            <p>But firſt it is remarkable, that this new Reply hath got a Licenſe, when none of his other elaborate Works could procure one; however, it is poſſible that the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer may hereafter renounce, or retract his Allowance in this caſe, as he hath done in ſeveral others already, when his Superiours are acquainted with the Contents and Tendencies of that to which he hath given his <hi>Imprimatur;</hi> for it is not to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that Miniſters of State will ever be ſo incurious of their Maſter's Honour, and the Rights of his Crown, as to approve their diminution, when once they perceive it.</p>
            <p>The ſingle Point which the Advocate for Magiſtracy aſſumed to maintain, was that the Indictment in queſtion was Legal and Good, ſufficient both for matter and form, and did warrant the Judgment which was pronounced upon the Verdict that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med its truth; this ſeems the principal Aſſertion in that Paper, which whether his Precedents and Authorities, Arguments and Reaſons, are ſufficient to prove, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt judge; that the Caſes he cites are truly reported for ſo much as he uſes them, none can deny, and that the Law is with them upon the whole matter, ſhall be farther evinced.</p>
            <p>But ſince that Sheet hath made ſome noiſe amongſt angry Men, (which was little expected by him that wrote it,) it will not, I hope, be thought impertinent to ſpend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106204:9"/>a few Paragraphs upon the boiſterous and bluſtering Invectives and Remarks made againſt its Author in a pretended Reply. In his Vindication therefore I ſhall obſerve, the Temper, the Wit, the Gueſs, the Reaſon, the Religion, and laſtly, the Law of that Replication.</p>
            <p>As to the Temper, it ſeems to be writ under ſome diſappointment, for the Author doth in every Sentence declare his Paſſion, and plainly tells us that he was then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed; but whether his diſpleaſure were conceived at a paſt or preſent Chief, is not ſo eaſie to determine: To expoſe his fury, it is enough to repeat his Epithets of Daring, Bold, Impudent, Preſumptuous, Baſe, Ingenerous, Inſolent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this deſpiſed by his reputed Author, and ſmiled at by the real one. He is pleaſed to call the Sentence and Execution a plain Murther, which if ſo, ſure I am that he is bound in Conſcience to Proſecute an Indictment againſt the Judges, the Recorder, the Grand and the Petit Jury, the Witneſſes, the Clerks, the Sollicitors, the Gaoler, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and the Executioner, for they were all concerned either as Acceſſories, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, and demerit a Halter if the Repliant's Opinion be Law; but it is obſerved amongſt <hi>Honeſt Men,</hi> that none of theſe Parties ſhew any fear on't; and the reaſon they give for it is, becauſe the Indictment was as good as their Juriſdiction, and the concurrence of thoſe two makes them as ſafe as an Act of Indempnity can do: but all this was Paſſion.</p>
            <p>As to the Wit on't, moſt of his Readers are at a loſs where to find it, unleſs it be in his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſes, which do ſo hit the ſenſe of the Original, and contain ſuch ſtrong and pregnant flights of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry, that ſome of his Readers have compared them even with <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins;</hi> and others are of Opinion that they do not come ſhort of the Eſſays of the two <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> Poets, one of which Tranſlated <hi>Grotius, de Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate Chriſtianae Religionis,</hi> and the other <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton</hi> into Rhime, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality do declare that for Heighth of Fancy, Propriety of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Exactneſs of Rhime, he hath much out-done all thoſe: but for my part I believe that laſt Rhapſody was added not ſo much for the Ingeny ſake, as to menace the Anſwerer with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Sacrifice him whenſoever an occaſion ſhould offer it ſelf, and conſequently to doe what the whole Book complains of; but that Advocate is not ſo much a Coward as to be affraid on't.</p>
            <p>As for the Gueſs, it is very cunning, and argues more Figure Knowledge than true Judgment in Styles, Modes, Dialects, or Peculiarities of Speech, or Writing, for he will have the Author of that Sheet, to be the Author of the <hi>Antidote,</hi> though he never ſaw it till he had the misfortune to have read the <hi>Defence;</hi> and his particular Idioms are as different from thoſe of the <hi>Antidote,</hi> as they are from thoſe of the <hi>Defence;</hi> but this is all gueſs. He will have it one of the Council of that Trial, becauſe he hath put <hi>Council</hi> before <hi>Court:</hi> a Cunning Man would have gueſs'd the contrary, as ſuppoſing it done <hi>fallendi gratia,</hi> for the ſake of diſguiſe; but he may be aſſured it was mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that occaſioned that fault. He will have it to be the then Sollicitor, becauſe of his Reputation, which is ſuppoſed to be touched in that <hi>Defence:</hi> but his Readers think that that Gentleman's Figure for Learning, Honour, and Vertue is ſo far above the reach of a little Pamphlet, that all the virulent Reproaches of the <hi>Reply</hi> cannot Sully it, nor is it in the power of any Tongue or Pen to prejudice his Character in the World; but however it is prudent to ſuppoſe to my ſelf an eminent Adverſary, that if a Foil be my fortune, it may be the eaſier.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106204:9"/>
            <p>But ſince we are gueſſing, the World gueſſes that he who wrote the <hi>Reply,</hi> did write the half Sheet called the <hi>Juſtification;</hi> and it is really ſportive to read the <hi>Juſtifier,</hi> commending the <hi>Denfender</hi> for a learned worthy Perſon; and the <hi>Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> doing the ſame good Office for the <hi>Juſtifier,</hi> and almoſt in the ſame words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him: nay, he ſpends a whole Page in the fulſome Praiſes upon that <hi>Small Bulk</hi> Authour, and rejoices that the Work was done to his Hands, which is a very pretty jeſt. It is at moſt but <hi>R.</hi> for <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> for <hi>R.</hi> and <hi>R. A.</hi> ſtill, which is much better than the contrary practice, of which ſome Authours have been guilty.</p>
            <p>As to the Reaſoning part, the Reader muſt excuſe my brevity, for in truth there is very little in it of that nature; however a few remarks may quicken and revive that faculty againſt the next turn. The Advocate owns it to be writ in anſwer to his Defence, <hi>ergo</hi> it reflects upon the Nation's Wiſdom. He expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a Reſentment at my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s engaging in ſuch a weak and criminal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, <hi>ergo</hi> he reflects upon the Nation's Juſtice. He names the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> (though with the moſt tender Appellations that could be uſed,) <hi>ergo</hi> he reflects on that Lord's memory. He vindicates the Indictment as good, <hi>ergo</hi> he juſtifies all the Proceedings in that Caſe. He argues that the Sentence was legal upon ſuch a Verdict, <hi>ergo</hi> he is againſt the Reverſal. He puts a Caſe, offers a Point, and makes a Proof on't, <hi>ergo</hi> he is tranſcendently impudent. Theſe, and ſuch like, are the inferences, and do demerit a Laugh.</p>
            <p>As to Religion, I ſee none in it, unleſs it be in the mention of the Deviliſh Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Plot, which is ſtill as much to the purpoſe of his <hi>Reply,</hi> as the ſtory of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls was to that of his <hi>Defence;</hi> only Meekneſs is tranſparent in his Style, Humility in the Title Page, and true Chriſtian Charity in his Menaces of an exception out of the Act of Indempnity, which he repeats three or four times at leaſt, as if his whole intereſt were deſigned to promote it. The Gentleman's Danger is from publick and ſcandalous Actings in the Eye of the World; which were (ſays he) labouring to <hi>Support the Government,</hi> every Man knows what ſort; laſhing the innocent with a <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>ſharp Tongue,</hi> and <hi>inveigling</hi> of <hi>Juries</hi> with Rhetorical flouriſhes. Now to examin a little theſe three monſtrous Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, let us go backwards. As to the laſt, a Duty can never be a Crime; every Servant owes Truth to his Maſter, while ſuch: every Advocate is to doe his utmoſt, and a failure in it had deſerved both the worſt of Names, and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the <hi>Repliant</hi> could invent, or his intereſt procure. For all Mankind muſt agree, that the now Servants of the preſent Crown are obliged to doe the like upon the like occaſion; if otherwiſe, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſide will be the ſafeſt. I will not reflect on the weakneſs of the Juries that were thus inveigled, if any ſuch there were, but rather ſuppoſe that the Oaths of Witneſſes, not the Pleading of Council, did govern their Conſciences. As to the ſecond, that is falſe, and needs no other anſwer. As to the firſt, the Gentleman's Honour and Merit afterwards, is as remarkable as his Fault at firſt, if it were any; but however he is likely to have abundance of Company, in Deſert at leaſt, if not in Cenſure: for a Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Creature is certainly as culpable as a King <hi>James</hi>'s Servant. And <hi>Andrew Marvel</hi>'s Characters in his growth of Popery, will be as true a Directory to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher Criminals as the four Volumes of noted Tryalls. And perhaps if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106204:10"/>of <hi>May</hi> 10. 1650. ſhould chance to be revived, danger and fear may ſeize other Men, as well as thoſe that ſerved paſt Governments; it is therefore thought adviſable for all to ſit down quiet, and forgive and forget what is paſt, but ſerve God and their Majeſties for the future, and not belabour the excepting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if any ſhould be ſuch Fools, the Knaves will get the better of it, and the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved. So much for Religion.</p>
            <p>Now for the Law if we can find it: But becauſe the <hi>Defender</hi> ſeems ſomewhat diſpleaſed at the repetition of that unhappy Lords name, whoſe Caſe gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the preſent queſtion. Let us therefore put it like Mooters, <hi>John a Styles</hi> was indicted, for that he, at ſuch a time and place, did compaſs to deprive his Natural Lord the King, that then was, of his Regal State, and to deſtroy his Life, and to ſubvert the Government, and raiſe a Rebellion, and to fulfill that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he, together with others, did then and there conſult and agree to raiſe a Rebellion againſt the ſaid King, and to ſeize and deſtroy the Guards of the ſaid King's Perſon, contrary to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The queſtion was not whether <hi>J. S.</hi> was Guilty? nor, If the Witneſſes ſwore falſe? Whether his Attainder were fit to be reverſed? But the diſpute was, Whether that Indictnent were legal? Whether ſuppoſing <hi>J. S.</hi> to be found Guilty, the Court that pronounced the Sentence of Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ought to have arreſted ſuch Judgment on the motion of <hi>J. S.</hi> that the Indictment was inſufficient? The Sheet argues that the Indictment was good, and conſequently the Sentence purſuant thereto was warrantable by the Laws of this Land. The Argument ſeems founded both upon the Reaſon of Things, and the Authority of Precedents.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Reaſon alleadged was, that the laſt part, which in Lawyers terms is called an Overt-act, was a natural and genuine Senſe or Declaration, or Overt ſignification of the firſt part, which is an internal ſecret Thought, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Compaſſing, which is the Treaſon prohibited and condemned. That the latter directly and conſequentially tending and conducing in the common Senſe and Reaſon of all Mankind, (excepting the <hi>Denfender,</hi> and two or three more,) to the accompliſhment of the former, makes a good and ſufficient charge within the Stat. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. A Repetition is tedious, and an Abbridgment is ſcarcely poſſible, the whole Sheet being but a Breviate, I ſhall therefore refer you thereto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Authorities there urged, are either the Opinions of Judges and other Lawyers, or Precedents of Indictments of the like, or the ſame nature, from which the Legality of this may be juſtly concluded: The ſubſtance of them on the whole matter is, that Overt Acts to depoſe the King, or deſpoil him of his Regal Office, or take him by Force or ſtrong Hand, or to impriſon his Perſon till he yields to the demands of thoſe who practiſe ſuch endeavours, are ſufficient Overt Acts to prove the Compaſſing and Imagination of his Death. That levying War, cauſing an Inſurrection, promoting an Invaſion; nay, that Conſults, Conſpiracies, Practices, Advices, Letters, Perſuaſions, and other Motives, and Preparations to an Inſurrection, or Invaſion, though none ſucceed, have been held Overt Acts of Imagining the King's Death. I will not repeat the Caſes, but as occaſion offers from the other ſide.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106204:10"/>
            <p>The Objections there mentioned and anſwered from the Penning of the Statute, are too trivial to deſerve a remembrance, nor would they have ever been thought otherwiſe, but that <hi>J. S.</hi> was a Noble Perſon, and the <hi>Defender</hi> a great Man, and the Prefacer thought ſo too, either by himſelf or others. Theſe and ſuch like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients have made ſome ſemblance of difficulty: and in truth, had there been a real doubt in the Caſe, the Authour of the <hi>Remarks</hi> on that Tryall, who wanted neither Senſe nor Will to cenſure it, had his Opinion ſo inclined, I ſay, he would certainly have fallen foul on it in thoſe invidious Obſervations of his upon the late Times. He quarrels with the Legality of the Jurors, the <hi>Defender</hi> with that of the Indictment, and both with the evidence. The Authour of the Sheet differs from them in the two firſt, but aggrees with them in the laſt, that Teſtimony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for fear of Life, or hopes of Pardon or other Reward, is hardly creditable; but that is not the Point. Let us ſee if the <hi>Replication</hi> doth overthrow the Charge as inſufficient; and for my part I cannot find a Line of Argument in it, but only it is naught, becauſe it is naught. The conſulting and concluding to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Rebellion, and ſeize the King's Guards, is not a Declaration of the Party's compaſſing the King's Depoſal or Death, and why? Becauſe conſpiring to levy War is not a levying War, and levying War is a diſtinct Treaſon; this is the ſubſtance of the tenth Page, if I can read: The Sheet ſaid truly, That le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying War it ſelf might be alledged as an Overt Act of Compaſſing, and hath been ſo frequently, and meeting and agreeing to rebell and ſeize the Guards, hath a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to promote a Demiſe of the King either natural or civil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might as well be alledged an Overt Act as moſt things whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot one Clauſe, and that is the unneceſſarineſs of making 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. if it ſhould be as the Advocate argues; I ſuppoſe he means the firſt Paragraph, for the ſecond is agreed to be introductive of a new Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the firſt is only a Paraphraſe upon the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. It is thus, <hi>That if any Perſon or Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhall within the Realm or without, compaſs, imagin, invent, deviſe, or intend death or deſtruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or deſtruction, maim or wounding, impriſonment, or reſtraint of the perſon of our Sovereign Lord the King, or to deprive or depoſe him from the ſtyle, honour, or Kingly name of the imperial Crown of this Realm, or of any other his Majeſty's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or Countries, or to levy war againſt his Majeſty within this Realm or without, or to move or ſtir any Foreigner or Serangers with force to invade this Realm, or any other his Majeſty's Dominions and Countries being under his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance, and ſuch compaſſings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them ſhall expreſs, utter, or declare, by any printing, writing, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or malicious adviſed ſpeaking, being legally convicted thereof, by the Oaths of two lawfull and credible Witneſſes upon Tryall, or otherwiſe convicted or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by due courſe of Law; then every ſuch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall,</hi> &amp;c. Now what is this but a confirmation of the old Statute in words at length; which was agreed to be ſo in the Houſe of Commons, 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. when a motion was made to renew that Law, the Lawyers Anſwer was, that the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. did the ſame thing, and a Man may boldly ſay it, that here's nothing declar'd Treaſon, but what had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd ſo before, and Attainders and Executions had purſuant to it: The Sheet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106204:11"/>mentions Caſes enough, and to the purpoſe, though ſome think otherwiſe; but I'll not repeat them.</p>
            <p>In the 11th Page the Reader is referr'd to the juſtification in the half Sheet; and therefore let's examine that a little: a third part of it is ſpent upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but that is not within my Province, which is only to vindicate the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication: As to the reſt, the force of it, if any, ſeems only to be founded on his firſt Aſſertion, the conſpiring to doe a thing is not the doing a thing, and he quotes two great Mens Names for it, I would have agreed that, though he had ſpar'd the Authority to juſtifie it; but this is ſufficiently anſwered in the Sheet: He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers an Argument from the late Statutes declaring Treaſons, becauſe they were temporary, but I anſwer as the Sheet doth, they were in affirmance of the old Law, and I can ſhew him three or four temporary, and an hundred other Acts of Parliament that are ſo, and therefore that is no argument at all; but I am, as the Party I juſtifie was, confin'd to a Sheet, and therefore cannot enlarge.</p>
            <p>He lays down a Rule for conſtruction of Statutes, that a thing particulariz'd in one part is not to be conſtrued within the general words of another part, but that Rule hath near fourſcore Exceptions in the Books; beſides it comes not to this Caſe, for here's compaſſing the King's Death made Treaſon, and declar'd by Overt Act; then levying War is made Treaſon: Now ſays the Repliant, nothing can be an Overt Act of and conduce to promote and accompliſh the firſt, that doth any ways concern the latter, I ſay it is a <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> for there are ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances mentioned in the Sheet, which reſpect the levying War, and yet are a genuine evidence of the intention and compaſſing; and if ſo, the Judges who have ruled ſuch Indictments to be good, did neither aſſume an arbitrary Power, nor tranſgreſs any Rule of Law, as the half Sheet inſinuates.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Caſe is endeavoured to be anſwered, by a Wonder that Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> late Lord Chief Juſtice, and then Sheriff, ſhould differ from Mr. Attorney <hi>Cook;</hi> for we know his thoughts in Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s time, and his Speeches in <hi>Car.</hi> I. his time; they are as different each from other as the times were, and in this particular that Gentleman hath had more followers than Precedents; but the Query is, What is Law?</p>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Caſe is endeavoured to be anſwered by this, that <hi>Syder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin</hi> mentions not the Overt Act in the Indictment, but he doth ſay the Treaſon alledged was a compaſſing the King's Death, and every Man knows what Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane</hi> did to accompliſh that: he neither ſign'd the Warrant to execute that Murther, nor was he actually concerned in it; the Juſtifier ſays he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it printed any where but in <hi>Syderfin</hi>'s Reports; for the refreſhment of his Memory, I'll tell him of another Book where it is, and that's <hi>Keble</hi>'s Firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Reports, 304. and there the Indictment is ſaid to be for Compaſſing the King's Death, and endeavouring to accompliſh the Treaſon, by changing and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furping the Government, and levying War, which Caſe doth directly overthrow all the Defender's, Juſtifier's, and Repliant's Arguments from the diſtinctneſs or difference of the ſort of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Then for Dr. <hi>Story</hi>'s Caſe, he ſays 'tis hard to juſtifie it for Law; whereas there are above forty places in our printed Laws Books, where 'tis cited and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106204:11"/>to be Law: Now 'tis pretty odd, that a Caſe ſo reſolved and ſo ratified, ſhould one Hundred and eighteen Years after, be arraigned in Print, for 'twas <hi>Hill.</hi> 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> if any thing be Law, that is ſo, and not diſtinguiſhable from this Caſe in queſtion, but that the Evidence was different, which the Juſtifier would make a reaſon to invalidate this Indictment; the Logick of it paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: beſides, 'tis obſervable, that the Benches were fill'd both with Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Integrity in 1571, and 1662, neither of thoſe times were Tory or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh; and in <hi>Dyer,</hi> 298. the reaſon given was, That it could not tend but to the great peril of the King's Perſon, and therefore an attempt to promote ſuch Invaſion, though none followed, was adjudg'd as aforeſaid. In 2. <hi>Anderſon pl.</hi> 2. <hi>fo.</hi> 5. <hi>Grant</hi>'s Caſe, 'twas held, That when any Perſon intendeth or contriveth to levy War for a thing which the Queen by her Law or Juſtice ought or may doe in Government as Queen, it's not material whether they intend any hurt to her Perſon; but if they intend to levy War againſt the Office and Authority of the Queen, that's enough, and that reſolution overthrows the Juſtifier's Notion, that <hi>J. S.</hi> his deſign was only to defend the Laws, though the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> alſo was then in force, it's a good Argument to anſwer that pretence.</p>
            <p>Now I have repeated and obſerved all the Replication or Juſtification offers in anſwer to my Friend's Sheet, the Reader may perhaps expect ſome new Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not ſo much for confirmation, as to give occaſion for a farther defence. In Sir <hi>Fr. Moor</hi>'s <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 621. <hi>pl.</hi> 849. on the Tryals of the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> before the then High Steward, the Juſtices did there reſolve, that when the Queen ſent to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> the Keeper of her Great Seal, and others, with a Command to him to diſperſe the Perſons armed which he had in his Houſe, and to come to her, and he did refuſe to doe ſo, and continued the Armour and Armed Perſons in his Houſe, that this was Treaſon; and they did alſo reſolve, that when he went with a Troop of Captains and others from his Houſe to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and there prayed Aid of the Citizens to aſſiſt him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Life, and to go with him to Court that he might get into the Queen's Preſence, that he might be ſufficiently powerfull to remove from her his Enemies who were then attendent, that this was High Treaſon, becauſe it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a force on the Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I make no inference, let the Reader doe that; 'tis plain that an actual mental intention of hurt is not material in the one Caſe or other. As the Duke of <hi>Norfolk's</hi> Caſe is related by <hi>Cambden</hi> in his Hiſtory of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 163. the Treaſon which the Duke confeſſed, was a Plot to ſeize upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and deliver the Queen of Scots; and that's all.</p>
            <p>There's nothing remains in doubt, but the legality or illegality of the King's keeping Guards for the preſervation of his Perſon; they ſay the Law takes Care of him, and therefore he is to take none of himſelf, and that the Judges are his Guards, and therefore he needs no other, that <hi>Henry</hi> VII. was the firſt other. But let us reaſon a little; can it be King that had any ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he ſhould be ſo ſacred in his Perſon, ſo great in his Power, and of ſuch Authority as to make War or Peace abroad, and raiſe Forces and ſuppreſs them at home, as the Danger or Defence of his Realm ſhould require, and not be able to provide for his own Perſonal Safety <hi>de preſenti?</hi> Can he only puniſh by his Judges afterwards, or prohibite by Proclamation before, but not defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106204:12"/>for the preſent? Is it ſenſe to ſuppoſe it? The Kings of <hi>England</hi> might have, and actually had Soldiers or Guards (call them what you will) even in times of Peace, and long before <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. as well as continually ſince; I may be ſo bold as to defie any Man to ſhew me the Year, the Month, the Week, or the Day, ſince the Conqueſt by <hi>William</hi> I. that <hi>England</hi> was without armed Men actually upon Duty in ſome part or other of the Nation. This Sheet is not intended for a ſtudied Argument on this Subject; and perhaps it would be difficult to juſtifie a ſtanding Army as warrantable, when there's no occaſion for it; but to ſay he can't by force, even by force, provide for his own perſonal Safety, when he apprehends it in danger, as every Engliſh King hath continual reaſon to doe, eſpecially if ſome Mens Doctrine prevail, it may be modeſtly affirmed unreaſonable: Hath not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Subject power to keep Arms as well as Servants in his Houſe for defence of his Perſon? Is not his Manſion called his Caſtle? And yet the Law protects him too by Prohibitions <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and Puniſhments <hi>ex parte poſt:</hi> There are many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures in <hi>England</hi> which oblige to the annual payment of certain Summs towards Soldiers Wages for Defence of the King and Kingdom; there are others oblige to the annual finding certain quantities of Grain in kind for the ſupplying the King's Caſtles and Garriſons, as well as Houſhold; which being annual, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the lawfulneſs of their continuance, even in times of Peace, and their being immemorial do conclude a Common Law right in the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to have thoſe Occaſions, as they do conclude him a Right to have them ſupplied by ſuch like Services: Nay, Grand Serjeantry is either by Services of Attendence on the King's Perſon in time of Peace, or for Military Aids, in time of War. The Crown may raiſe Forces by Commiſſion, or of the Militia, to ſuppreſs Inſurrections, in Caſe the Civil Power of the Sheriff is not ſufficient or ineffectual. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have the ſole Power and Force of the Nation; Complaints have been in Parliament againſt Billeting Soldiers contrary to the Will of the Hoſts, but never for maintaining a Guard for their own Perſon at their own Charge; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have been of a ſtanding Army, but never of a ſelect Company for his perſonal preſervation; a Terror to the People may as well be pretended from his Coachmen, Footmen, or Grooms, if their Numbers be great: Beſides, for a competent Power in Arms he always may have occaſion, when his Subjects know nothing on't; 'tis his Province to foreſee and prevent as well as ſuppreſs and puniſh domeſtick Tumults, and the Buſineſs of War is ſeparately his Office, and that excluſive of his Subjects, any otherwiſe than as they are bound to obey and fight, or deſired to aſſiſt with Aids and Subſidies; and for this, to avoid a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Volume of Citations, I'll name one notable Roll or two <hi>in Parliament.</hi> 6. <hi>Ric.</hi> II. <hi>Mem.</hi> 9. the manner and way of the proſecution of a War being given in Charge to the Commons to adviſe upon, they anſwered, that this <hi>nec doit nec ſolayt</hi> appertain <hi>al cux mes al Roy,</hi> and ſo they did, 31 <hi>Edward</hi> III. <hi>Parte. prim. n.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21 <hi>Edward</hi> III. <hi>n.</hi> 5. It's true in 5 <hi>Edward</hi> II. <hi>n.</hi> 4. Ordinances were made, that the King without the aſſent of his Barons could not make War; but thoſe were repealed and dampned, 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> II. <hi>Parl. Rot. M.</hi> 13. becauſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Royal Power of a King; and this is ſufficiently affirmed by the Act concerning the Militia in <hi>Carol.</hi> II. his time. It is well known in what time
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106204:12"/>
               <hi>Bryan</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, that if all the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> ſhould war with the Subjects of another Kingdom, that this is no War, unleſs the King denounces it: It ſuffices for my Friend's Point, that the King may lawfully have armed Men or Guards, when himſelf judges his Perſon or People to be in danger, or ſtand in need of them: And that he may, when reaſons of State will not admit their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication to the World. But however fome ſtanding Force the Crown ever had and ever will have, though not always to ſuch a Degree as ſhall be burdenſome or oppreſſive; and our old Law Books ſay that Arms as well as Laws are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Prince, not only in but againſt the times of neceſſity, I mean War or Tumult; beſides in <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>de Corona,</hi> 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Crimen leſae Majeſtatis</hi> is the greateſt Crime, becauſe of the greatneſs of the Perſon againſt whom 'tis committed; his deſcription of it is, <hi>Preſumptio contra perſonam ipſius Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis;</hi> then when he particularizes the ſeveral ſorts of Treaſon, the firſt which he names is, <hi>Si quis auſu temerario machinatus ſit in</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> towards) <hi>mortem domini Regis, vel aliquid egerit vel agi procuraverit ad ſeditionem Domini Regis vel exercitus ſui, licet id quod in voluntate habuerit non perduxerit ad effectum.</hi> I'll make no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence, there needs no Paraphraſe, the words are plain; an Act tending to the deſtruction of the King's <hi>Hoſt</hi> is High Treaſon againſt his <hi>Perſon, agere ad ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem exercitus regis eſt preſumptio contra perſonam Regis, &amp; preſumptio contra per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonam Regis eſt crimen leſae Majeſtatis:</hi> Now can <hi>Bracton</hi> be thought to ſpeak only of Treaſons in time of War? <hi>Glanvil. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Crimen leſae Majeſtatis dicitur de ſeditione Domini Regis, vel regni, vel exercitus;</hi> and <hi>Fleta. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>De ſeductione exercitus ſui: &amp; cap.</hi> 21. the ſame words, <hi>ſeductionem cjus vel exercitus ſui;</hi> this was the ſenſe of the old Law, and is very appoſitely applicable to the Caſe in queſtion, as I could eaſily ſhew, would my Paper bear it. There is one thing which I had quite forgot, and that is, that the Inſtrument of Grievances which the Prudence of the preſent Parliament hath provided, complains of a <hi>Standing Army;</hi> the Anſwer is eaſie, 'tis not of <hi>Perſonal Guards,</hi> and the wiſe enquiry of the Houſe of Commons into the <hi>quantum</hi> requiſite to maintain ſuch and ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces during the preſent occaſion, and of the Expences of the Crown in Houſhold, Courts, Guards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> afterwards do plainly ſhew, that that was not the intended Grievance: Now to ſumm up what is not anſwered at all or endeavoured to be ſo by the Defender, nothing is ſaid to the reaſon of the thing, or the neceſſity and nature of an Over-act, to the opinion of <hi>Coke</hi> in the places cited, to the Caſe of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> the Caſe of the Cardinal, the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Conſtable,</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Owen,</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Burton,</hi> the Caſes of <hi>Sparhauke, Awater,</hi> and <hi>Heber,</hi> the Indictment againſt Sir <hi>William Aſhton, Germain</hi> and <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Burdett, Collingbourne,</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> nor to the Opinion of the Judges in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe, as if 'twere all impertinent, but the Reader is Judge if it be ſo.</p>
            <p>Now for the Preſacer, I'll be as ſhort upon him as he was upon my Friend; he ſaid that the Sheet needed a vindication, and I have given it one, and if this needs another, I hope the Crown will find a Friend to write ſome Third. He ſeems ſo us'd to the word <hi>Libel,</hi> that he cannot forbear calling it an <hi>infamous</hi> one; he ſays it has not one true material word in it; I'll remember him of one,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106204:13"/>that Mocking is catching in the Proverb, that is <hi>A Grumbletonian in the Stirrup ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally proves a Tyrant—in the Saddle;</hi> that's enough for him to remember: If he wants any more truth, and that he may not ſay this hath none in't, Treaſons are eaſier committed than diſtinguiſh'd, by ſome Men eſpecially, and the reaſon why I ſay this, is becauſe of his Octavo Preface when he is grumbling ſtill, for I always thought that he had ſmarted too much for Libelling on Miniſters of State and Male-Adminiſtrations, to venture again; but when a Prieſt meddles with Law, he is like an Apothecary at Politicks, he generally runs himſelf into a Nooſe, for he'll ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave off till he's advanced one way or another. To conclude, the deſign of the Sheet was to juſtifie the Prerogative of the King and Queen, and the Rights of their Crown; and the Republican is angry that either ſhould have any, and from thence flames the Paſſion; nay, rather than it ſhould be allowed, they'll attempt another change, from which good Lord deliver us. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.2.</p>
            <p>During the compoſure of the Premiſes, News was brought me that another Pen had been procured to attack the Vindication, <hi>viz.</hi> The Author that runs a-muck at all Mankind, except his own Patroons: A deſerved and full remark upon ſo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous a Book, is not here to be expected, however, this Appendix may ſerve for an Advertiſement to the World, that the new Repliant is in ſeveral particulars obliged to Solicitor <hi>Coke,</hi> and the other Regicides defence on their Tryals for much of his Materials; time is wanting to ſhew the Parallel; at preſent 'tis fit to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that his blind ſide alſo is apparent, and conſequently capable of a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Anſwer, and to give my Reader a Specimen thereof, I'll take notice of a few (amongſt many) Miſtakes, both in Fact and Law, which he hath wilfully commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the firſt Page he ſays, That to juſtifie what hath been taken ill, accuſes the preſent Government of Injuſtice; which is falſe. In p. 2. he ſays, that the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ventures on a point of Law which it pretends is the reſult of the Evidence given; there's no ſuch pretence in the whole Paper, the only debate was upon the Indictment. He ſays in the ſame Paper, that it's ſaid his Relations were pleaſed with the juſtneſs of the Tryal; it only ſays, his Relations were pleaſed, and his Enemies angry with thoſe who then ſate upon the Bench, and that's true; for ſome of his Relations cannot deny it, the Fact is ſo well known. The laſt line of P. 3. and firſt of the next are alſo falſe, for 'twas neither written, perus'd, nor approv'd by any of his pretended Criminals: I believe they thought the Point too clear to need a Vindication; but this is juſt like his wonted poſitiveneſs in his Remarks, where for inſtance he ſays, that one of the Judgments he cavils at was the firſt that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given without Argument or Reaſons delivered in Court, which is alſo falſe; for in <hi>Plowden</hi>'s Comment. 459. In Sir <hi>T. Wroth</hi>'s Caſe, the Author takes expreſs notice, that the reaſons of the Judgment were not diſcloſed when the ſame was pronounced; and Fifty other Caſes I could name him of the ſame, but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is enough to falſifie a general indefinite Poſition, though there are ſeveral more even in that very Book.</p>
            <p>But to run over his Volume, Pag. 2. is only a farther ſcurrilous Reflection to vindicate his own Remarks, and an impertinent bombaſt of words on the Phraſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> proceedings: The 3 P. aſſigns four Reaſons of Printing, the two laſt are applicable to himſelf only, and he thinks ſo of the fourth, or elſe his Story is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106204:13"/>like.—In the 4 P. he boulſters up himſelf in his Railery, by reſorting to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of the Parliaments Authority that reverſed the Judgment, which all Men agree to be juſt, but it was not becauſe the Recorder did not arreſt the Judgment on that trivial Exception to the Indictment, but becauſe the Proſecution was ſuppoſed malicious, and the Evidence ſuppoſed falſe or deficient, or both.</p>
            <p>The 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10th. Pages are all impertinent to the Point in queſtion, and contain nothing but a Vindication of his juſtly condemned Clamour in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book; concerning which, I'll boldly ſay it, in ſeventeen Points of twenty he is out in his Law; if 'twere convenient to publiſh the proof on't, I could make it plain. His deſign is to ſhew in thoſe Pages his Wit and Fancy, more than Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor or Law; for my part, I am of his Friends mind that he comes not ſhort of the old Obſervator for mannaging a Dialogue: But all this is not to the purpoſe, he is not come at it yet, the 12 Pag. ſavours of the ſame Kidney, and 13. and 14. are no better: there he vents his Gall, and that in Ribaldry; no ſofter a name than Tools can be afforded to Men of Worth and Honor: If himſelf be one, as ſome ſuppoſe him, I am ſure it is not to the preſent Government, for he plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it, and declares the People, <hi>i. e.</hi> his ſort of them, unſatisfied with it, for its ſpatingneſs in vengeance; and it is becauſe others are not puniſhed for maintaining the Law, and themſelves not preferred for Arraigning it: ſome Men know my meaning. He ſays he is only for mumbling of Judges and Counſel, <hi>Cauſa patet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt tell him two things, 1. The Incinations of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and the Laws of the Land, will never quadrate with a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſuppoſed Criminals do not depend on their Number, but the Law, which ought, and will juſtifie them; if it doth not pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, let it be changed by Parliament, or if the Author thinks that a tedious way, let us burn all our Law Books at once, and then perhaps his <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>Reply</hi> will be thought to be Reaſon, and himſelf the greateſt and only Lawyer in the Realm; but till then, he muſt give others leave to know, and to ſay that they know, he is miſtaken: For Reſolutions, and Opinions, purſuant and agreeable to the Opinions and Rules of former Ages, I mean, frequent and repeated Precedents, approved by the Lawyers of the Age that uſed them. I ſay theſe will be Law to the end of the World, unleſs altered by new Statutes.</p>
            <p>And now we are come to debate the Queſtion, all that is paſt is upon the Times, and not the Point. In p. 18, is his Reaſoning part, which is no more than was ſaid before in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To redargue him I muſt repeat; if therefore he will obſerve what is ſaid by the Sheet p. 22. I will ſay no more on't, but ſubmit to the Judgment of the Reader; he ſays the inferences are Ridiculous, I ſay they are Rational and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine: The ſingle Iſſue is, if his, or my Friends Arguments are the moſt Logical and Natural, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>Now for Authorty, let us ſee if he urges any on his ſide, or anſwers that on the other. He admires (p. 24.) at the aſſurance of the Sheet Author, and others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at his. He ſays the Parliament had often adjudged it, but none can ſhew any Judgment in the Houſe of Lords, or Vote of the Common Houſe to that purpoſe. I have ſhewn the Senſe of the preſent Parliament in the Point of Guards, and his temporary Laws are already anſwered; nor would any Man but he, and one more,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106204:14"/>pretend that they are Judgments in the Caſe. Surely it will not be pretended that his Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. time, is any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Nor is it any Argument to ſay, no King of <hi>England</hi> was ever killed for want of Guards.</p>
            <p>Now for Caſes p. 26. He ſaith that in the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Caſe there was an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al War Levyed, and that, as I ſaid before, deſtroys the Argument from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts of Treaſon. As to Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>'s Caſe, he only ſays there was another Statute in force then, but no Record or Hiſtory ſays that he was indicted on any other than the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. As to Dr. <hi>Story</hi>'s Caſe, he tells a long Tale out of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> about the Fact, but anſwers not one word to the Indictment, whatſoever the Evidence was, the Indictment was as the Sheet alledges, and that is enough.</p>
            <p>His anſwer to <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Caſe is that, that things hapning afterwards proved more, but the Evidence was no more than what my Friend alledges. As to Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Caſe, his anſwer is, his own hear-ſay of what was proved, but the Judgment he never peruſed, <hi>argued like a Lawyer.</hi> As to <hi>Constable</hi>'s Caſe and the reſt, he gives no anſwer, but only that a repetition of a number of Caſes makes a mutter and a noiſe, and ſo it does when they Govern and Rule the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and are not anſwered. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Caſe, he ſays, the Author preſſes it ſtrangely and that is all. He ſays the Caſes of <hi>Burton,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk, Awater, Heber,</hi> and <hi>Crohagn,</hi> are not to the purpoſe, let the Reader judg if they are not pertinent: As to the Opinion of the Judges in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe, he doth not mention it, but ſays the reviving that Caſe might have been ſpared, and that is all, a pretty anſwer: As to <hi>Colledg</hi>'s Caſe, he talks of a proof of a ſelf Defence, but nothing to the Point it was urged for. As to the Caſes of Lord <hi>Cobham, Gray,</hi> and <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> in 32, 33, 34, 35. pag. Setting aſide his ſcandalous Invectives and Reflections upon thoſe Times, Miniſters, and Governments, he no ways attempts to anſwer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from them, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Charge was the ſame as in the Caſe in Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to any Man of Senſe and Reaſon that will Read and Think cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the <hi>Repliant</hi> hath offered any one Argument more than the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Caſe, Defence and Juſtification had alledged. If he hath ſhewn any one Judgment where ſuch Indictment was reſolved naught; if he hath given any anſwer to Dr. <hi>Story</hi>'s, <hi>Collingborn</hi>'s, Sir <hi>William Aſhton's, Burdet</hi>'s, and Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi>'s Indictment; in ſhort, if he hath anſwered any two of the Caſes cited: or if he hath done any thing but reflect on paſt and late times, and if the Indictment remain not good, both for matter and form, notwithſtanding all theſe pretended Replies. Upon the whole matter, I deſire the Reader to peruſe the Book cited, and to judg if there be not preſidents enough unanſwered to juſtifie the Indictment in queſtion, and that the Recorder gave a good Judgment upon the Verdict that affirmed its truth; <hi>quod fuit Probandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Since the <hi>Repliant</hi> is in love with <hi>Horace,</hi> I would adviſe him to conſider one hint of his

               <hi>The third and laſt part of the Magiſtracy and Government of</hi> England <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with Reaſons for a General Act of Indemnity,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT hath been the obſerved misfortune of moſt mix'd Governments, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our own, never long to enjoy the entire Friendſhip of all its individual Subjects; the lowermoſt Side hath too frequently acquired the greateſt ſhare of the Peoples Love, or at leaſt Pity: It's then no point of Wonder, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of former Crowns ſhould incur their proportion of Envy, Hatred, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and amongſt all thoſe none more obnoxious to it, than the Miniſters, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and Inſtruments of Juſtice; for ſuch are the vitiated Sentiments of Perſons intereſted in all Suits, that the Vanquiſh'd is certainly injured, or thought, or ſaid to be ſo, which is all one, by the Perſons themſelves, their Friends or Relatives, their Patrons or Creatures. In truth there's ſcarce a Tryal on the Plea or Crown-Side, but one party, and ſometies both, do leave the Court with a ſwinging Curſe or two on Judge, Council, Jury, Witneſſes, and perhaps all concerned; upon which account, it can never be deemed a juſtifiable, much leſs a commendable and meritorious Imployment, for Lawyers to note and report, and afterwards publiſh to the World the Clamors of ſuch Malecontents, with the addition of Sarcaſm inſtead of Argument, and bluſhleſs Lies inſtead of Law and Precedents, and all this under the pretence of ſerving their Majeſties and the Government, but 'tis a mere pretence; for firſt, it's not their Province; theſe Publications are made by them, not as Legiſlators or Judges, but as private Perſons; and one of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſeems calculated only for private Lucre, as either the hopes of a Place, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Practice, by telling the Town in the firſt and laſt Pages where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor lives, of what Profeſſion, and how long ſtanding; an Art learn'd from ſome of thoſe exquiſite Doctors inhabiting towards the Fields, whoſe Knowledge and Converſation is pretended to be in Heaven: Another writes for Bread, and ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that he may eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A third, or rather the firſt and prime, is inſpired with Venom and Revenge, even the pure Spirit on't, as one baulk'd he is angry at all, and becauſe ſome were not his true Friends, he's reſolved to make Enemies of thoſe who deſpiſe him, and of them the number is great. But ſecondly,</p>
            <p>It's of no uſe to the preſent Government, for Truth only can be a ſure <hi>Baſis</hi> of Reſpect to that; and in caſe of Slander, the Filth rebounds, and the Dirt thrown moſt ſurely turns on, and dawbs their own Faces, eſpecially when they arraign thoſe as ignorant, whoſe Learning, Knowledge, and Judgment, are ſo clear and acknowledged, as to render the Cenſors unworthy even of being their Bag-bearers; the like when they cenſure thoſe as corrupt, who have always bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done their Duty, even in defiance of a Court Cabal, or a Popular Faction: who have always adhered to the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law and their juſt Opinions in it, though Frowns from <hi>White-hall,</hi> or Clamors from <hi>Wapping,</hi> though Lampoons from <hi>Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> or a worſe uſage from an <hi>Obſervator,</hi> though a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> or a <hi>Take him,</hi> &amp;c. were the only reward they could expect for ſuch their (formerly called Puritanical now Arbitrary) Juſtice: Gentlemen who never polluted the Law (which the great and good Sir <hi>Mat. Hale</hi> did truly call a robbing the Poor of Juſtice) for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106204:15"/>a Farm or an Office, or a lumping Summ for Sale of it; who never begg'd an Executorſhip for to gain a Fortune; Gentlemen who never gave ſtrained Opinions concerning the Revenue when made for their Clients the Farmers, but clamored at the ſame when uſed by their King with more Moderation; Gentlemen who parted with their Places, though of Honor and Profit, rather than comply with a Court-O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion or a Club-Notion, when others (I name no body) offered entire and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Service, if they could have preceded or ſucceeded them, (Teſte .... <hi>apud</hi> St. <hi>James</hi>'s and the City of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>) but miſſing their aim then, as now they do their Gall muſt have a Vent, and ſo it hath with a Vengeance, when a true and bold Juſtice is made the Subject on't: The Reaſon is plain, thoſe Men's Repute is too great for Truth, Probity, and uſefulneſs: An Eclipſe is neceſſary if poſſible, for if otherwiſe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender will never be Keeper, the Remarker Solicitor, nor the <hi>Gray's-Inn</hi> Poet wear Scarlet in <hi>Wales;</hi> their hopes are but ſmall, unleſs they can poſtpone all their B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tters by Death, Commitments, or that which is but little worſe, Reproach and Slander; but ſome think their Sting grows weak, for 'tis apparent that there are a ſort of Men, who though they might and did love his Majeſty when as Prince, yet do not, will not, cannot love him, or any Man elſe, as King; and this is now pretty plain. But Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Their Libels are criminal, and injuricus to common Juſtice, for they create a Diſreſpect and Contempt upon all Judiciary Proceedings; to arraign all paſt is to excite a Suſpicion of all preſent and future Adminiſtrations; whereas <hi>Plowden</hi> ſaith, fol. 38. <hi>It's a good and ſure way to believe the laſt Judgment;</hi> and if ſo, 'tis plain what Name the contrary Practice deſerves; beſides, were it otherwiſe, the Inſtitution of Judges and Courts were vain, and our State, as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> the moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; for we have no Rule but <hi>ex ore Judicum,</hi> or from particular Statutes, and of them they are the Expoſitors. Now let's inquire which is Law, the Defender's Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his Argument <hi>inter S.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> or the Judgment in the Exchequer Chamber, affirmed by the Lords? If the Judicial Reſolution be ſo, then the Publication of his Argument was ſcandalous, and I am not to follow him as my Guide; but perhaps he'll tell me, That manifeſt Reaſon and good Lawyers ought to govern me; if ſo, then I ask him, Who ſhall I follow in the E. of <hi>D</hi>'s Caſe of a <hi>Capias pro fine puis Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. whether the cleven beſt Lawyers, or the Vote of the Houſe? If the latter, why not ſo in the former Caſe? And if otherwiſe, then his Judgment was miſtaken; ſo that <hi>quacunque via data,</hi> there's no Infallibity in this World, and conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quently no excuſe for private Cenſures of publick Proceedings in Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: Beſides, the Books are pretty clear, that ſuch things are puniſhable; but I leave the Reader to peruſe them at leaſure. Now let us but conſider the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that muſt enſue upon the publick countenancing ſuch a Practice as theſe Scriblers have introduced; for if allowable on a disbanded Judge, 'tis ſo on a ſitting one, for the Caſe is the ſame in reſpect of private Lawyers who pretend to think their Judgments erroneous or corrupt; but ſurely both are unlawfull. Beſides all this, in the preſent Caſe</p>
            <p>They have palpably wreſted the Law in divers Inſtances: I need name no more than the Indictment in queſtion, which that it was legal and good, moſt Men do now agree, eſpecially ſince the dint of the Oppoſal ſeems current only on the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with a Waiver of the other, the Indictment being good ſince that Guards
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106204:15"/>are proved lawfull, and the Obſervator concedes it the moſt legall part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, and the Juſtice of Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuppoſed written by the Defender, ſtrains all it's Forces on the Evidence and the Times; and their Follower, the Port, in his new <hi>Non-conformiſt,</hi> pag. 10. runs the ſame way too: only</p>
            <p>There remains one Objection to the firſt Vindication, which is, that it affirms, Words may be Treaſon within the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and the Remarker challenges a proof of it, and asks where it may befound; and the <hi>Non-conformist</hi> quarrels at the Lawyer that did aſſert it, and ſome others have done the ſame <hi>ore tenus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs, that the firſt Sheet did publiſh the Aſſertion, but waved it's Eviction, for ſear of a ſtrained uſe of ſuch Opinion to ill purpoſes, for the ſerving à turn upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Occaſions; nor had there been any more ſaid on it, but that their Confidence and Malice ſeems ſo exorbitant as to extort a Check, for the Regulator is grown ſo confident of his own Knowledg as to under-value the greateſt of Judgments; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his Common-place Book affords us no Title but Colluſion and Malice prepenſe; and his Practice hath been much of the ſame ſtamp, only that ſometimes he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little of the Lunatick as appears by his Rhimes, Prophecies, Dreams, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and other Religionary Works.</p>
            <p>To prove the Aſſertion, I depend not on the Authority of the ſenſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Houſe. 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. though (let the Cryer for Juſtice, or who elſe pleaſes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it) it was in Fact then affirmed and agreed unto, and upon that, the then King's Council and Courtiers deſiſted the Motion and Proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cution of a Bill to make Words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that's a ſupernumerary Argument, there's more than enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>I am not to maintain that all rank, malicious, groſs Words againſt the King or Queen's Perſon are ſuch, nor that whoſoever drinks an Health to our Sovereign Lord the People, or to the late King <hi>James,</hi> is a Traitor; but that Words ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative and expreſſive of a preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ention to do an Act to the King's Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch Words deliberately, maliciouſly, and adviſedly ſpoken on purpoſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the Demiſe of the King, as by promiſe of Money with importunity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Fact, may be an <hi>Overt-facit</hi> to prove the Imagination within. 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>To evince this, let us think a little ..... and 'twill be plain</p>
            <p>The words of this Statute are clear and of an eaſie Conſtruction, if we will allow thoſe dull old Times to ſpeak Senſe: They are to this effect, That if it ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs or imagine the Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>de ceo provablement ſoit attaint per overt fait:</hi> Now the Objection is this, That Words are not Deeds within that Clauſe; to this the Anſwer is very clear; for by all the Grammatical and other Rules for Interpretation of the Senſe of Words, the latter part of a Sentence is to be conſtrued (if uſed by way of oppoſition) as oppoſite to the thing mentioned and intended in the foregoing Part, and not as oppos'd to every thing which it may <hi>ex vi ter mini</hi> exclude in other Caſes; and this is an agreed difference, both amongſt Divines in Expoſition of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in Scripture, and Grammarians in allmoſt all Caſes whatſoever: Now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Overt facit</hi> is uſed not in oppoſition to Words, for there's no ſuch thing menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; but 'tis added in contradiſtinction to that which was before ſpecified, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoughts, and ſuch are Imagination and Compaſſing; and therefore <hi>overt facit</hi> muſt mean any open manifeſt thing as can truly diſcover thoſe Thoughts, as may prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106204:16"/>attaint the Traitor of ſuch his Imagination; and it is a moſt natural and proper Mode of Speech, if they did intend, as moſt undoubtedly they did, that the Thought ſhould be the thing prohibited, then 'tis as plain they intended by the Word <hi>fait</hi> any diſcovery of ſuch Thought by Words or Actions; and ſo ſaid <hi>Newton</hi> in 19. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. That to imagine the Death of the King is Treaſon, though he doe no act towards it, if ſuch Imagination be diſcloſed that it can be tried if he did ſo think and imagine. If that thoughts and Words are mentioned both in a Sentence, and afterwards Deeds in oppoſition, then the laſt will exclude both the former; but here when uſed only in contradiſtinction with Thoughts, it ſeems plainly otherwiſe. That Deed, when uſed in Oppoſition to Thought, doth include both Words and Acts, none can deny; a thouſand Inſtances might be given of it; and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt propriety of Speech, Words are Deeds when and as contradiſtinguiſht from Thoughts; for the Soul thinks even as abſtractly conſidered from the Body, but Man never ſpeaks without Action and Motion: The difference is plain, and needs no Explication. But further,</p>
            <p>I would fain know, What is a Conſult or Plot, but the mutual and reciprocal Declaration of two or more Traitors Minds each to the other? Each declares his Traiterous Imagination by Words, and ſo of an Agreement to commit the actual Murther, 'tis but a Declaration of their Minds by Words each to the other, only they do happen to agree. Now ſuppoſe one Man thinks and intends to deſtroy the King, and by Words doth willingly, deliberately, and adviſedly declare this to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that is not of his Mind, though by miſtake is thought to be ſuch; is not this the ſame thing? If a Man traiterouſly offers and promiſes to another a thouſand Pounds to perpetrate the villanous Act; if he accept it, and a parole Agreement is made between them accordingly, ſurely the Apologiſts for Treaſon will agree that to be an overt Thing, and both guilty, if it can be proved by two Witneſſes of credit. Suppoſe then the Party offered and promiſed doth abhor and refuſe, will that make a diſtinction? If it does, 'tis without a difference: Perhaps the Word Conſult will be called a new Cant; we know whoſe Coin it is, and who gave it the firſt ſtamp; 'twas no leſs a Man than Sir <hi>Will. Jones,</hi> who at the time of ſuch his Invention was no Perogative Lawyer, though conſiderably ſo in Times then lately paſt: Nor is it imaginable what is the meaning of a Conſpiracy or Plot to take away the King's Life, but a Communication by Words between ſeveral Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors concerning ſuch Act, and the method of it's Accompliſhment, and a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Words of each Man's being fixed in that purpoſe; which if it be proved by ſufficient Teſtimony, will undoubtedly be an Evidence of a Compaſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the Treaſon Prohibited and Puniſhable; nor can the Meeting make it more ſo, for they could not diſcourſe unleſs they met; and therefore 'tis the Words only that are the manifeſt <hi>overt fait.</hi> Nor doth <hi>Hugh Pynes</hi>'s Caſe, or the Reſolution of the Judges therein, contradict this, notwithſtanding the Confidence of the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker that it did; they only ſay that the Words in that Caſe were not Treaſon, that thoſe Words were not an Evidence of Compaſſing, that for thoſe Words he could not be Indicted upon that Statute; but their Opinion doth plainly imply, That had the Words been Evidence of a Compaſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they were only ſlanderous and reflective, it had been otherwiſe; and the Inſtances there mentioned are full to this, as <hi>John Quick</hi>'s Indictment was only for Words to King <hi>Henry,</hi> unleſs ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106204:16"/>up and ſpeaking will alter the Caſe: <hi>Thomas Koiver's, John Clipſham</hi>'s, and <hi>John Mirfield</hi>'s, are all for Words, and ſome others there ſpecified. Beſides, it's obſervable that in moſt Indictments on this Statute, ſome Words have been alledged in them as an <hi>overt fait</hi> to demonſtrate the Imagination, which would be impertinent if the Law were thought otherwiſe. I'll not inſiſt on <hi>Colledge</hi>'s, becauſe the Caſe hath been cavilled at, though with no colour as to the Indictment: Part of <hi>Patrick Harding</hi>'s Indictment was <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo publicavit,</hi> but I'll not dwell on that, becauſe fooliſhly drawn; but <hi>Arthur Crohagan</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> is pretty full and for Words; and the Words of the Book are, That the traiterous Intent and Imagination of his Heart was declared by his Words, and therefore held High Treaſon within the expreſs Proviſion of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and upon his coming into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> he was arreſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now no Anſwer can be to this, but that he came into <hi>England;</hi> but the Words only ſhewed his Intent, and by that Book the Words are alledged as the <hi>overt fait;</hi> beſides the Caſe of <hi>Blanchflower</hi> and <hi>Atwood, Mic.</hi> 5 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>B. R.</hi> in <hi>Yelverton</hi>'s Reports 107. <hi>per curiam,</hi> reſolved, that Words may be Treaſon; and that is an expreſs Reſolution; for there was then no temporary Law in being concerning Parole Treaſons that I know of. The Caſe of <hi>Berisford</hi> and <hi>Preſſe. Hill.</hi> 8 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>B. R. Yelvert.</hi> 197. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, that Treaſon may be committed by Speech as well as by Act, for any thing which diſcovers the Mind of a Man to be Traiterous to his Sovereign, is capital to the Party: <hi>Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham ad Brook Paſch.</hi> 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Hutt.</hi> 75. held <hi>per cur.</hi> that the ſpeaking of Treaſon was Treaſon, and that <hi>ſermo eſt index animi</hi> as well as Preaching or Writing; and no Man can doubt but thoſe are Acts; and Speech is as much ſo.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the Conſequence of the contrary Doctrine be well conſider'd, 'twill appear to be a plain Evaſion of the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. as is manifeſt upon the reading it; and the common Books are full of this, for otherwiſe no Action could lie for ſaying a Man hath ſpoke Treaſon: But here's enough ſaid to anſwer the Challenge, where's the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for ſuch an Aſſertion? Though infinitely more might be ſaid for it, nay 'tis as eaſie to dumbfound the contrary as 'tis to tranſcribe Law Caſes. If this doth not give them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, they ſhall remain unſatisfied for me, I'll plague the World no more with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on this dull, flat, unprofitable Subject, Crown-Law, leſt I ſhould provoke our new Scriblers to double the Plague by their Replies: If they attempt an Anſwer, I'll leave the Tobacconiſt and Grocer to confute them, and unleſs a Trunk or Band-box chance to bring them to my View, I'll never be tempted to read them; and of this they may aſſure themſelves. I ſay it to complement the Reader with Patience to peruſe the reſt of the Sheet, being aſcertained never to hear more on't, at leaſt not from this hand.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may wonder at the reaſon of the Publication of theſe Sheets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them the product of Malice on one ſide, as thoſe virulent Pamphlets are on the other: To ſolve that Scruple, I need only repeat the Reaſons alledged in the firſt; but a Repitition is damnably dull, as well as tedious and irkſome: I'll therefore add a new one, and that's to ſhew the Reaſonableneſs as well as the Neceſſity of a general, indefinite, ſpeedy Act of Oblivion; for though the Bloud-hounds fret, and huff, and bounce, as if all their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Rage were founded on a true <hi>Baſis,</hi> yet 'tis apparent from the Premiſes, that their foundation is falſe, and the Law is direct and plain in their Teeth, and doth and will juſtifie in moſt of the particulars, at which they foam their Curſes and Execrations: Reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as neceſſity enjoins a ſilence as to what is paſt, for otherwiſe the Kingdom can never have it's deſired ſatisfaction, for in points juſtifiable, or at leaſt doubtfull; the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106204:17"/>of inflicting Puniſhments can never be vindicated, did I call them Puniſhments, I beg the Readers Pardon for the Impropriety; however I'll not name their proper term, but with calmneſs, endeavour to Evince three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it would be gratefull to the Nation in general, and every good Man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 2. Conducing to the Settlement and Interreſt of the preſent Government; and laſtly, That 'tis conſiſtent with the promotive of the higheſt and trueſt Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Nation did and doth expect it, for Revenge is never natural but when freſhly purſued, and time wears off the ſenſe of Injuries, by the Intervention of new ones either real or imaginary, which is all one as to this purpoſe: The horror of any Crime, or at leaſt the deteſtation of the Criminal, grows faint and languid upon the removal of the Object, eſpecially if time interpoſes with the acceſſion of preſent fears, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do more affect us than greater if more diſtant. It can never therefore be thought the deſire of the People of <hi>England</hi> to have their Nighbours or Acquaintance harraſs'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by Fines, Conſiſcations, Impriſonments, Marks of Diſgrace, or the like, for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done in the laſt or former Reigns, about which the World hath been ſo much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if lawfull or not: Beſides, that this was the general Expectation of the Kingdom on the new Settlement or at leaſt the Coronation, of which nature there never was an Inſtance before this without an Act of Grace; and it is moſt plain, that none are Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to it, but the <hi>Republicanes</hi> and the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> not for that they need it not, as I ſhall ſhew anon, but for different ends, each drives at and wiſhes a Change, it matters not to what, for if to the latter the other hopes a Common wealth will be the more deſirable: If the <hi>Republican</hi> ſucceeds, then the other believes a Reſtoration the more eaſie, but both diſlike the preſent, and therefore dread a Settlement, and conſequently dread the People's ſatisfaction, and quiet under Their Majeſties, and conſequently dread an Act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
'tis true, the cry for Vengeance is loud, but 'tis only from theſe two corners; which leads to the ſecond particular, that</p>
            <p>It will eſtabliſh and promote the Intereſt of the preſent Government, while the popular Bully is full of his Damme's and Menaces, there's certainly danger, and where there's danger there's fear; now fear cauſes an averſion, and averſion begets hatred: And the Object of it is that from whence the ſuppoſed danger ariſes, which is from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment irritated by the Venom and Fury of thoſe hot headed Animals, whatſoever hath power and will to hurt me, muſt and will be abhorr'd; and though none are immediate actual Patients, yet the being poſſibly obnoxious to it, and the want of ſecurity for the contrary doth of neceſſity cool their reſpect to the preſent Power, under which they were not ſafe; and this tempts them and their Friends upon contrivances and attempts of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, both to Themſelves and the Publick; and danger by the attempt is no diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the like danger attends their forbearance: And this is of weight, unleſs <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Polliticks be thought Chriſtian, to cheriſh and promote a Flot, as of advantage to Settlement, if ſeaſonably diſcovered and ſubtilly managed; but however 'tis as true, that Enemies who are deſperate ought never to be thought inconſiderable; for they may ſhake and batter what they can't deſtroy, they may do miſchief though they can't work ruin to their Adverſaries, upon which account the temptation of coutinual impending Danger is fit to be removed: Beſides</p>
            <p>The want of Security, and the fear of Danger, making Men uneaſie in their thoughts, repleniſhes them with Complaints and Murmurs at every awkard Action, or ſuppoſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106204:17"/>miſcarriage of the Government feared; it makes them Mutineers at publick Taxes and Impoſitions, partly becauſe they think it ſtrengthens and increaſes the power of hurting them, and partly becauſe it ſponges and bleeds them of that, which they fear an occaſion of themſelves to bribe Black-rods, Sergeants at Arms, and other Goalers with; and in a conjuncture when extaordinary Aids are indiſpenſibly requiſite, no temptation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is deſerving of Countenance; beſides, that it cramps Trade and diſcourages Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for Publick Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but farther, it's the living, not the dead, the happy, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and chearfull, and free, not the oppreſſed, miſerable, forlorn, or impriſoned Subject, that doth Service to the Crown and the Publick.</p>
            <p>It hinders all ſuch as are thought to be ſo obnoxious from any bold Eſſays for the uſe of the preſent Government, for that if ſucceſs be the attendant of ſuch their attempt, they continue unſafe notwithſtanding, for no Man will adventure an hazard to ſecure that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which he is not ſure will make him ſafe, if he doth undertake the preſent Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſcapes that Danger, and performs the Service; ſo that Self-preſervation renders it their Policy to unhinge themſelves from, or to be ſhy of the preſent Power; of which a conſiderable number might prove uſefull Friends, which are now Newters at leaſt, if not Enemies.</p>
            <p>It's obſervable in all foreign Policies, either to work a total Extirpation of the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or an univerſal Indemnity, after ſo grand a Revolution as this was; the former is not to be practis'd here for two Reaſons: 1. Becauſe we want People: 2. Many of our Friends muſt be baniſh'd too, for divers of the ſuppoſed Criminals were inſtrumental to the preſent Change, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> the latter only is, and can be moſt adviſable; for once I'll ſuppoſe their numbers but ſmall in compariſon to the Saints and Innocents, (if any ſuch there are in the Nation) yet under our preſent Circumſtances all are to be obliged as Friends that poſſibly may; but if the thirteen Heads, with the Surrenderer's Clauſe, and all it's and their Subdiviſions had been reduced into a Law in the deſigned Act of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one third at leaſt of the Nation had been involved, who with their diſobliged Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Dependants is not ſo contemptible a Flock, though but of Sheep for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Beſides,</p>
            <p>It's impolitick as well as unjuſt to deny or delay it to thoſe who have ſubmitted to the Government, yielded it Obedience, and quietly bore it's publick Charges according to their Proportion, and yet give a free, full, and general Pardon, both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to all that took up Arms, for all their Sins then paſt and preſent; it provokes the former to repent their non-concurrence with the latter, for 'twas but reſuming their Quiet and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at pleaſure, and then they were ſafe, which now they are not, but under continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Menaces and Dangers both, as appears in their being baited by every barking Cur, that can but write with Gall in his Ink, or ſpeak with a Damme in his Mouth.</p>
            <p>Experience farther tells us, that nothing turns or changes the humor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commoner, like Rage, Inſolence, and Cruelty in their fellow Subjects, when made Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and ſuch is raking into old Sores thought to be; it matters not whether juſtly or no as to this purpoſe, the effect is generally ſuch: The Star-Chamber in <hi>Car.</hi> I. his time, the Major-General's in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s: The Tophamizing of Abhorrers in <hi>Car.</hi> II. his time: The Weſtern Campaign, and the other criminal Proſecutions in the beginning of <hi>Jac.</hi> I. I ſay all the Violences uſed in theſe ſeveral periods (and yet they had their reſpective Provoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations) did moſt notoriouſly alter the kidney of the Commons, and made even their once
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106204:18"/>beloved, firſt dreadfull and terrible, then odious and loathſome; they produced conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Changes in their ſeveral Conſequences: I could come nearer home even to the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> and other Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> which firſt turn'd the Stomach of that City, as is now apparent; but <hi>Sat verbum, &amp;c.</hi> But farther,</p>
            <p>The want of this renders both the Policy and Honor of the great Bellowers for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to be juſtly ſuſpected: 1. Their Honor in taking care of their own Servants for all their Exceſſes upon the Revolution, and oppoſing the Indemnity of all others, as by the Act appears: 2. Their Policy, for that it's obſervable in Story, that the Aſſociation in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> time was under a Proteſtant Prince for the Proteſtant Religion, and no ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs attended it, yet thoſe wiſe Anceſtors of ours thought fit to ſecure themſelves by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Aſſociation into a Law, and a general Act of Indemnity; I do not ſay they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, but the Aſſociators in that Reign thought it needfull; and 'tis very conſiderable, that in no Reign was there more Peace and Quiet than in Hers, and in none were there ever more free and general Pardons, and in truth the latter was the occaſion of the former; for when Men are once ſafe and quiet, no ſmall Temptation will provoke any more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures though they like another better, yet Men being eaſie are generally contented; There was one free and general Pardon of the Queen's at firſt confirmed, 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 11. another, 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 18.13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 28.18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 24.23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 16.27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13.29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 9.31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 16.35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap 14.39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 28.43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 19. Eleven in number, and never five years without a Parliament-Pardon, and this made Parliaments and Crowns the darlings and deſire of the People. Beſides, It's the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of each party amongſt us, though ſome don't ſee it; the <hi>Whigg</hi> ought to promote it for two Reaſons: 1. Leſt being the leſſer part he chance to feel the want of it, and for that he has given ſome Provocation. 2. That if he be the greater, the Memory of his Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Fury may be forgotten, and himſelf reſtored to the good Opinion of the reſt of Mankind, by one act at leaſt of good Nature: The <hi>Tory</hi> ought to purſue the ſame meaſures, and much for the ſame Reaſons, for his Top-gallantry hath been, and if repractis'd will be again as odious and loathſome to the moderate and good, as ever it was, or as the others could be: Temper therefore is now the Game, and a Veil over all that's paſt is certainly the moſt Politick, eſpecially conſidering the multitude of the ſuppoſed Criminals, and the juſtice of their ſeveral Excuſes, which comes next: For,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It's conſiſtent with and promotive of the trueſt and higheſt Juſtice, for in moſt of the Caſes the Law is doubtfull, and to puniſh Opinion in matters of Law, is as unjuſt as to perſecute miſtakes in matters of Religion is unchriſtian, and new Laws for Government <hi>de futuro</hi> are more agreeable to natural Equity, than a retroſpective Fury; that it is ſo, is plain, the modern Scribles have ſufficiently proved it. In two of the Caſes cited they differ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for Dr. <hi>Story</hi>'s Caſe, the Defender crys 'tis not Law, the Remarker agrees 'tis, and that he was well hanged; for <hi>Plunket</hi>'s Caſe, the Defender cries, he was well hanged, for there was Treaſon enough in his Charge, the Remarker inſinuates as if he ſuffer'd hardly; now what ſhall a little Lawyer believe between theſe two great bodies of learning? the like may be ſaid of <hi>Soames</hi>'s Caſe, and the other above mentioned: But what is more? In the Voluminous Argument againſt the <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> owned by Sir <hi>R.A.</hi> he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede that there are ſome Prerogatives ſo perſonally and inſeparably inherent in the Crown, that no Act of Parliament can cramp or diminiſh, or at leaſt take away; and that being granted, I'm ſure all that the reſt of the Book ſays can never make that a plain Caſe, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106204:18"/>in truth his own Argument ſhews and and leaves it a diſputable Point; and if that were doubtfull, every particular elſe may well be buried in Oblivion: beſides in Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the nature of the thing admits of doubt, and then there's no colour for Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides,</p>
            <p>In reſpect of inferiour Perſons by our Conſtitution they are obliged to ſubmit to and follow <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> which is the <hi>lex loquens Angliae,</hi> and when all theſe things are duly conſidered, there will remain but few grand execrable Criminals, who are fit to be made Examples of, only to tickle ſome, aggrieve others, and terrifie none; for that will be the conſequence; for that's the caſe of all Violence, where the Juſtice of the thing is not clear and undoubted. Then for Exceptions:</p>
            <p>Let us think a little; Is it reaſonable that ſome ſhould ſuffer for not being affraid of Puniſhments never declared or promulgated, and others ſhould eſcape, becauſe their Countenances are more fawning, or that by conſent their Relations have plaid on the other ſide, or that their ſwinging Fortunes enable them to ſcatter Mice for their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Indemnity, or that they have had the lucky Principle of being faithfull to all Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and true to nothing elſe, or that they have been forward to ſubvert their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, after their fire and folly had ruined him, and endangered themſelves: theſe and ſuch like are no Pleas for Juſtice, and yet this is the Caſe. Farther,</p>
            <p>The drift is to magnifie and aggrandize Puniſhments by Bill, which by the ſtanding Laws and common Juſtice of the Realm could not be inflicted, and they urge two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, 1. Their particular Pardons will otherwiſe excuſe them. To that I anſwer, Either they are valid in Law or not, if not, there's no need of Bills; if they are valid in Law, the ſame Law and Juſtice of the Land enjoin their allowance; even the ſame Law by which the Countrey-man plows his Land, the Gentleman receives his Rent, the Trader recovers his Debt, and the Senator ſits in the Houſe; and by the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that theſe enjoy their Properties, the Criminal ought to have his Pardon allowed, for one's a right accrued by the Law as well as the other. 2. The common Chanel is too ſmooth; Severity is ſometimes neceſſary, and that now if ever; and therefore the Legiſlative Authority ought to exert its power, and puniſh according to demerit. To anſwer that, I ſay, either they are no offences by Law, and there needs a Bill to make them ſuch, and inflict evils upon them as ſuch; or elſe they are offences, but deſerve a greater Puniſhment than a common Court may pronounce: Now if the firſt be the Caſe, then I'm ſure
'tis rank palpable tyrannical Injuſtice, and that's the Plague of living under an an Arbitrary Power, for none can know what's not Criminal: If they mean the latter, as I ſuppoſe they do, then I ask, to what end were Puniſhments inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Societies, but to reſtrain Men from doing particular actions through the power and influence of Fear? And how could that Conſequence be expected, when the penalty was never known before 'tis inflicted? and to inflict an evil afterwards, which was not known before, is to make a man ſuffer that which he could not fear, becauſe he could not know it, and this becauſe he did not fear it: And the Juſtice of that is plain too.</p>
            <p>I agree with the Satyriſts, that there are ſome Precedents of this laſt method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, but moſt of them are repealed; I'll name two that are ſo, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s which the very Law it ſelf did enjoin Poſterity not to obſerve, or follow, or doe the like; I can't forget one expreſſion of his to this effect upon the Tryall, if there be an Errour in a Judge, ſo that he give a ſentence otherwiſe than a Man of better underſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106204:19"/>Reaſon for, there's no cauſe the offence ſhould be hightened, becauſe he was not ſo wiſe a Man as he might have been, nor ſo underſtanding as another; which if allowed, will make it more eligible to follow a Plow than ſerve a Government, to dig in a Ditch than bear an Office; for all Men ſtand obnoxious to the Conſtructions and Paſſions of ſucceeding Times. There's one Iſtance more, and that was Sir <hi>Tho. Haxey</hi>'s, who was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of Treaſon, for bringing in a Bill into the Commons Houſe againſt the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, though while and as a Member: I ſuppoſe the Sparks will not much applaud the juſtice of that Procedure for their own ſakes; but as I ſaid before, that, and moſt others of their Precedents, were repealed, when a cooler Aſſembly met upon the next Seſſion, and ſo was <hi>Haxey</hi>'s, in 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Cott. abr. rec.</hi> 362, 363.</p>
            <p>But if Vengeance be requiſite, it ought to be without reſpect of Perſons, the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of it ought to be <hi>impartial, true,</hi> and <hi>Catholick:</hi> and then come in the Penſioners and Surrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the Regulators and Promiſers, the old High Commiſſioners, and the new Creed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, God knows, <hi>quis non? &amp;c.</hi> Nay, ſince the Revolution ſome muſt come in for a ſnack of Cenſure too, the buyers and ſellers of Places, the Members that took Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrary to their own Motion and Vote in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation-men for prohibiting of importing <hi>French</hi> Commodities under pain of Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ship and Goods, three Weeks before a War proclaimed, contrary to eleven Acts of Parliament for Free Trade, even in Parliament-time: the Treaſury for farming Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which are common nuſances, contrary to multitudes of Statutes, and continuing them ſtill with <hi>non obſtante</hi>'s in the Indenture, though illegal, and void <hi>ab initio:</hi> the great Seal for paſſing four Patents at one Seal in this <hi>Lent</hi> Vacation, with <hi>non obſtante</hi>'s, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Bill of Rights: the new Sheriffs for practiſing what themſelves condemn'd in a <hi>Moore</hi> and a <hi>North, Cum multis aliis, quos nunc deſcribere longum, &amp;c.</hi> To conclude, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Rule, if obſerved, will be the moſt infallible Indemnity that can be contrived, and that is, <hi>John</hi> 8.7. <hi>Let him that is without Sin amongſt you, caſt the firſt ſtone.</hi> And in truth a Cenſor of the Manners of others ought himſelf to be pure, clean, and innocent <hi>in omni re quacunque;</hi> and if there be no danger but from ſuch, I'm ſure there's no danger at all, and that it ſhould be ſo, is the trueſt Juſtice in the World, <hi>quod fuit probandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'll not mention the Argument from the Vacancy, that the Government was diſſolved, every thing reduced into its primitive ſtate of Nature, all Power divolved into individuals, and the particulars only to provide for themſelves by a new Contract; for if ſo, there's yet no new conſent for Puniſhment of acts done before the Diſſolution, and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for that is at an end; Indemnity therefore ought to be promoted by thoſe who made that Vote, for otherwiſe their truth may be ſuſpected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
